{"ID":28552891,"ABSTRACT":"The purpose of laboratory testing of seed germination is to assess seed quality or viability and to predict performance of the seed and seedling in the field. Seed processed for sale must be tested by a qualified laboratory under the Association of Official Seed Analysts Rules for testing seeds. Several different kinds of testing are available depending on the type of seed to be tested, the conditions of the test, and the potential uses of the seed. The most common tests are the warm germination test, cold germination test, accelerated aging test, and the tetrazolium test. Each test is designed to evaluate various qualities of the seed. Factors that can affect the performance of seed in germination tests include; diseased seed, old seed, mechanically damaged seed, seed stored under high moisture, and excessive heating of seed during storage or drying. In most cases a seed treatment will improve germination of seed only if the poor quality is due to seed-borne disease. . . The most common test is a warm germination test because it is required by seed laws to appear on the label. The percentage of germinating seed in a warm germination test must be printed on the label of the seed if it is to be sold as seed. Germination is defined as: \"the emergence and development from the seed embryo of those essential structures which are indicative of the ability to produce a normal plant under favorable conditions.\" The warm germination test reflects the stand producing potential of a seed lot under ideal planting conditions. Usually 400 seed from each seed lot are placed under moist conditions on blotters, rolled towels, or sand and maintained at 77 degrees F for about seven days. At the end of this period the seedlings are categorized as normal, abnormal, or diseased, and dead or hard seeds. The percentage germination is calculated from the number of normal seedlings from the total number of seeds evaluated. . . The cold germination test is designed to measure the ability of seeds to germinate under high soil-moisture content and low soil temperature. This vigor test simulates early season adverse field conditions and usually represents the lowest germination that would be expected from a seed lot planted under such conditions. Actual field germination would normally fall between the cold test result and that of the warm germination test. Seeds are planted in a sand-soil mix at high moisture content and maintained at 50 degrees F for seven days. The test is then placed at 77 degrees F for four days. The percentage of healthy seedlings that emerge at least one inch above the soil is reported. . . The accelerated aging test estimates the carryover potential of a seed lot in warehouse storage. The seeds are exposed to high temperatures and high relative humidity for short periods of time that cause seed deterioration. Seed are suspended over water in a chamber for 72 hours (wheat and soybeans) or 96 hours (corn) then tested in a standard warm germination test. This test only would be used on seed whose longevity was in question. . . The tetrazolium test is a \"quick test\" for seed lot viability. It is useful when an approximate germination percentage is needed immediately. Seeds are soaked overnight in water then treated with tetrazolium to give an indication of viable, abnormal, and dead seeds in the seed lot. This test will not detect seed-borne disease, thus is limited in its ability to estimate seed quality. This test is highly reliable for determining viable seed of corn, wheat, oats, barley, and other grasses. . . If growers wish to use bin-run seed and has not had a germination test conducted by a competent laboratory, they can get an approximate germination test using the following procedure in their own home. . . Place two paper towels in the bottom of a dish or tray, one on top of the other; wet the towels thoroughly and tilt the tray up on one end so that excess water runs off the tray.

{"ID":44733313,"ABSTRACT":"Actually, there are a lot of considerations to think about when bringing a bunny indoors.  Personally, I think it is a much better environment for them, but you need to understand that they may not immediately take to your surroundings the way you would like.  Firstly, there is the cage training/litter training thing.  Rabbits are naturally neat creatures and therefore are fairly easy to train.  The key is patience.  Also, if your rabbit has not been spayed, you might want to have this done as it will make potty training easier.  My suggestion is to line a cat litter pan with newspaper, then cover that in hay.  This will give the bunny a reason to go into the pan in the first place, as well as something to dig around in to cover up their \"business\" when they are done.  . . Another important thing to consider is chewing.  Because a rabbit's teeth are constantly growing, they chew to keep them ground down.  Make sure your bun has plenty of safe chew toys to play with.  Mine  love cardboard boxes, telephone books, wooden bird toys, and baby teething keys.  One thing to remember is that wires and the like are often found at floor level, making them a convenient place for a bun to chew.  Not only is this bad for your home electronics, it can give your rabbit a nasty shock too!  Your local electronics store should have some good, sturdy cable wraps to tuck away such temptations.  . . You should also think about restricting your rabbit's access to carpeted areas of the house.  Often rabbits will attempt to graze on carpet, which of course, destroys the rug in question, and can also make the rabbit sick.  Some rabbits never have this problem, and others are seemingly impossible to break from it, so it's all about trying things out with your bun, and seeing what works for you both.  . . If you have any specific questions about bunny training, or keeping house rabbits, feel free to e-mail me (hmelton@sbcglobal.net) anytime.  I currently have 3 sweet little buns living in my house, and have kept indoor rabbits for years.  . .

It usually takes place between the ages of 10 and 15 in both sexes but sometimes occurs as early as 7 or 8 years of age in females. The pituitary gland secretes hormones that stimulate enlargement and development of the sex organs, which thus become capable of reproduction. The appearance of secondary sex characteristics also occurs during puberty. In females the reproductive cycle of ovulation and menstruation begins, pubic hair appears, and development of the breasts and other body contours takes place. Physical changes in males include production and discharge of semen, appearance of facial and body hair, and deepening of the voice. Skin difficulties, such as acne, may affect both sexes. Puberty, a transition period coinciding with adolescence, involves both physiological and psychological adjustments. It is often marked by emotional stress arising as the adolescent relinquishes childhood behavior patterns and adopts those of an adult.. .

It has to do with your kidneys and their ability to drive out or filter those excess solutes in your blood. It also depends on the ability of your tissues (mainly muscles and liver) to store glucose as glycogen.. . So a headache is a multivariable phenomenon, I recommend you should drink healthy amounts of water every day and fruits.","NLTKTokens":["headaches","normally","caused","changes","blood","pressure","alter","intake","carbs","carbs","sugars","almost","salts","result","change","blood","pressure","mechanism","easy","explain","partial","osmotic","pressures","glucose","electrolytes","blood","hormones","regulating","concentration","kidneys","ability","drive","filter","excess","solutes","blood","depends","ability","tissues","mainly","muscles","liver","store","glucose","glycogen","headache","multivariable","phenomenon","recommend","drink","healthy","amounts","water","every","day","fruits"]}

If your arousal levels are getting too high and a climax is beginning, take a deep breath and think about something else, something very boring if possible.

If you find yourself nearing climax withdraw your penis from your partner and allow yourself to relax enough to prevent ejaculation. By starting and stopping sexual stimulation you can learn to prolong the sex act.. . Squeeze Methods can help prevent premature ejaculation. This method involves either the man or his partner squeezing (fairly firmly) the end or the tip of the penis for 10 to 20 seconds when ejaculation is imminent, withholding stimulation for about 30 seconds, then continuing stimulation. This can be repeated until ejaculation is desired. The stop and start method can be used with the squeeze method as well.. . Desensitizing Creams for premature ejaculation. Creams can be used to desensitize the end of the penis. They act like a local or tropical anesthetic. Thicker condoms (or two condoms) can also desensitize by decreasing sensitivity and therefore stimulation, thus prolonging the sexual act.. . More Foreplay prevents premature ejaculation. Stimulate your partner to a state of high arousal before you have your genitals touched, that way ejaculation and orgasm can be achieved about the same time.. . Masturbation to prevent premature ejaculation. Practice different methods by yourself. Getting to know your feelings and sensations gives you the chance to gain confidence.. .

{"ID":12874372,"ABSTRACT":"I love Dr Phil for one reason and here it is. . He continually asks his guests one simple question: \"How's it working for you?\". . Success in anything comes from FINDING WHAT WORKS then DOING WHAT WORKS.. . I am going to reveal to you the Secret Weight Loss Formula that Celebrity personal trainer don???t want you to know about.. . Before I reveal the secret, first I need to explain to you that there is process that your body goes through to burn body fat. . . So how does your body burn fat?. . It is a 2 steps process and in order you need to:. 1.Release the fat from the fat cells and only then. 2.You can burn the fat. . . That process is the same for every human being. I will outline the steps and then show you how you can easily apply some fundamental rules to allow your body to burn the maximum amount of fat with less effort and minimum time. Once you understand that simple process, you can easily see why you are not getting the results that you want. Even bigger, you will finally see that getting that dream body is getting so much closer to reality that you will be extremely motivated to get started as soon as you can.. . How does your body release the fat from the cells?. . Before you can turn your body into a fat burning machine, here what needs to happen: your body fat need to be released from the fat cells. You can accomplish this step successfully with your nutrition program. Here are some specific tips that you can apply right away to achieve that.. . 1.Eat 4-6 small, frequent meals and never skip meals.. 2.Include small amounts of good fats.. 3.Eat natural foods; avoid processed & refined foods. 4.Eat lean proteins with each meal.. 5.Eat more complex carbs, fruits & vegetables.. . The most misunderstood weight loss strategy. How to burn the *fat* instead of burning muscles.. . Releasing fat from the fat cells is not the end of it; actually, it is just the beginning. Because the fat needs to be transported from the fat cells to your muscles so it can be burned there. This is done through your blood and the cardiovascular system is responsible for that. The more effective is that system, the more effective your body will become at burning fat. You can improve your cardio vascular system by doing so cardio training.  However, don???t go out yet and spend 1 hour on the treadmill because you probably not going to be doing too much good like that.. . The reason is excessive cardio combined with a restrictive diet burns fat but mostly muscle tissue. That is not a good thing at all, because muscle tissue is where you burn the fat and if you are burning away muscle tissue, you are burning your ability to burn more fat in the future (weight loss plateau). You just don???t cut the hand that feed you. So cardio burns fat and it can also burn muscle tissue, this is a huge dilemma. Damn if you do, damn if you don???t. But wait there is a solution to that??. . You need to do some MODERATE cardio training. The key word here is moderate. . Doing too much cardio can be detrimental and I am sure you have seen those people that are doing cardio on a daily basis and still not getting anywhere. The result is a low metabolism. Low metabolism means, your body fat is not going anywhere, anytime . soon. Here is what you need to do:. . 1.Do some moderate cardio training; the key word here is moderate. 2.Never diet but consume little fewer calories that you will burn (No starvation diets, Please...). . The world most efficient ??fat burner??? is FREE and You already have it.. . Before I reveal to you how personal trainer get those celebrities in the best shape of their life in such short period there is one more thing that I want you to understand. Because it is very important. . Weight loss marketers always claim that they have the magic ??fat burner??? that will melt your fat away. The problem is that they have a new one coming out every year, so I wonder if the one from last year was so effective, why we need a new one.

{"ID":16869852,"ABSTRACT":"Emotional Intelligence, also called EI or EQ, describes an ability, capacity, or skill to perceive, assess, and manage the emotions of one's self, of others, and of groups. However, being a relatively new area, the definition of emotional intelligence is still in a state of flux. Some, such as John D. Mayer (2005a) prefer to distinguish emotional knowledge from emotional intelligence, as discussed below.. . In 1920, E. L. Thorndike, at Columbia University, (Thorndike 1920), used the term \"social intelligence\" to describe the skill of getting along with other people. In 1975, Howard Gardner's The Shattered Mind, (Gardner 1975) began the formulation of the idea for \"Multiple Intelligences\" (he identifies eight intelligences), including both interpersonal intelligence and intrapersonal intelligence. Many psychologists, such as Gardner, believe that traditional measures of intelligence, such as the IQ test, fail to fully explain cognitive ability. (Smith 2002). . The term \"emotional intelligence\" appears to have originated with Wayne Payne (1985), but was popularized by Daniel Goleman (1995). The leading research on the concept originated with Peter Salovey and John \"Jack\" Mayer starting in the late 1980s. In 1990, their seminal paper (1990) defined the concept as an intelligence. Mayer and Salovey continued to research the concept, and created an emotional intelligence test called the MSCEIT (Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test). The term \"emotional quotient\" seems to have originated in an article by Keith Beasley (1987). Bar-on (1997) developed a test measuring emotional quotient, called the Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQi). There are numerous other assessments of emotional intelligence each advocating different models and measures.. .

{"ID":39958444,"ABSTRACT":"Milky Way, the galaxy of which the sun and solar system are a part, seen as a broad band of light arching across the night sky from horizon to horizon; if not blocked by the horizon, it would be seen as a circle around the entire sky. Although its motion is not readily apparent, the entire galaxy is rotating about the Milky Way's center. Relative to the universe, the galaxy is moving at a speed of c.370 mi per sec (c.590 km per sec) in the same direction that the constellation Leo lies relative to the earth; it is also moving at c.60 mi per sec (c.100 km per sec) relative to the center of mass of the local group of galaxies. The sun, traveling at a speed of c.150 mi per sec (c.240 km per sec) in a nearly circular orbit, takes 200???230 million years to complete one revolution.. Visual Characteristics of the Milky Way. . Among the constellations the Milky Way passes through are Carina, Crux (the Southern Cross), Sagittarius (where it is brightest), Scorpius, Aquila, Cygnus, Perseus, Cassiopeia, Auriga, and Gemini. In the direction of Cygnus is the Great Rift, a band of dark matter that lies along the Milky Way, dividing it into two forks. Another dark region is the Coalsack, in Crux. Once believed to be vast empty regions in space, these dark areas are now known to be clouds of dark matter blotting out the light behind them. Such nonluminous clouds of dust and gas, called dark nebulae, obscure many parts of the sky from sight; in the direction of the galactic center, the view is almost entirely obscured.. . Size and Shape of the Milky Way. . The Milky Way is a large galaxy comprising an estimated 200 billion stars (some estimates range as high as 400 billion) arrayed in the form of a disk, with a central elliptical bulge (some 12,000 light-years in diameter) of closely packed stars lying in the direction of Sagittarius. It is surrounded by a flat disk marked by six spiral arms???four major and two minor???which wind out from the nucleus like a giant pinwheel. Because of these arms, the Milky Way was classified as a spiral galaxy. However, increasing evidence indicates that the Milky Way probably has a bar or barlike structure of new, bright stars in its central region. This would modify its classification to a barred spiral or an intermediate type between barred and ??normal??? spiral. Our sun is situated in one of the smaller arms, called the Local or Orion Arm, that connect the more substantial next inner arm and the next outer arm. The sun lies roughly two thirds of the way from the center of the disk, which is some 28,000 light-years distant, and in the galactic plane. When we look in the plane of the disk we see the combined light of its stars as the Milky Way. The diameter of the disk is c.100,000 light-years; its average thickness is 10,000 light-years, increasing to 30,000 light-years at the nucleus.. . Certain features of the region near the sun suggested that our galaxy resembles the Andromeda Galaxy. In 1951 a group led by William Morgan detected evidence of spiral arms in Orion and Perseus. Another bright arm stretches from Sagittarius to Carina in the southern sky. With the development of radio astronomy, scientists have extended a nearly complete map of the spiral structure of the galaxy by tracing regions of hydrogen that dominate the spiral arms.. . Surrounding the galaxy is a large spherical halo of globular star clusters that extends to a diameter of about 130,000 light-years; this is called the stellar halo. The galaxy also has a vast outer spherical region called the corona, or dark halo, which is as much as 600,000 light years in diameter and, in addition to dark matter which accounts for most of the Milky Way's mass, includes some distant globular clusters, the two nearby galaxies called the Magellanic clouds, and four smaller galaxies.. .

It is possible that yawns are contagious because at one time in evolutionary history, the yawn served to coordinate the social behavior of a group of animals. When one member of the group yawned to signal an event, all the other members of the group also yawned.

{"ID":21992691,"ABSTRACT":"the Finnish government recently funded a brain scanning study. The results turned up some hard-to-interpret, possible clues. It also confirmed the obvious: yawn contagion is largely unconscious. Wherever it might affect the brain, it bypasses the known brain circuitry for consciously analyzing and mimicking other people???s actions..        This circuitry is called the ??mirror-neuron system,??? because it contains a special type of brain cells, or neurons, that become active both when their owner does something, and when he or she senses someone else doing the same thing. .        Mirror neurons typically become active when a person consciously imitates an action of someone else, a process associated with learning. But they seem to play no role in yawn contagiousness, the researchers in the new study found. The cells are have no extra activity during contagious yawning compared with during other non-contagious facial movements, they observed..       Brain activity ??associated with viewing another person yawn seems to circumvent the essential parts of the MNS [mirror neuron system], in line with the nature of contagious yawns as automatically released behavioural acts???rather than truly imitated motor patterns that would require detailed action understanding,??? wrote the researchers, with the Helsinki University of Technology and the Research Centre J??lich, Germany. The findings are published in the February issue of the research journal Neuroimage..       But if seeing someone yawn doesn???t activate these centers, what does it do to the brain? The researchers found that it appears to strongly activate at least one brain area, called the superior temporal sulcus. But this activation was unrelated to any desire to yawn in response, so it may be irrelevant to the contagion question, the researchers added..        Possibly more significant, they wrote, was the apparent deactivation of a second brain area, called the left periamygdalar region. The more strongly a participant reported wanting to yawn in response to another person???s yawn, the stronger was this deactivation. .       ??This finding represents the first known neurophysiological signature of perceived yawn contagiousness,??? the researchers wrote.. Exactly what the finding means is less clear, they acknowledged. The periamygdalar region is a zone that lies alongside the amygdala, an almond-shaped structure deep in the brain in the area of the side of the head. The periamygdalar region has been linked to the unconscious analysis of emotional expressions in faces. Why it would be deactivated in tandem with yawn contagion is unclear, the researchers said..        One thing seems clear from the study is that ??contagious yawning does not rely on brain mechanisms of action understanding,??? wrote one of the researchers, Riitta Hari of the Helsinki University of Technology, in a recent email. Rather, she continued, it seems to be an ?????automatically??? released (and most likely very archaic) motor pattern,??? or sequence of physical actions..          In the study, volunteers looked at videos of actors yawning or making other mouth movements. Meanwhile their brains were scanned using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, a system that shows the amount of activity or work going on in various brain areas based on the amount of oxygen being used up there. The volunteers were later asked how strongly they had been tempted to yawn while viewing the pictures..       Apart from the physical brain mechanisms of yawn contagiousness, researchers have offered different reasons as to why it exists. Some have proposed that in early humans, yawn contagiousness might have helped people communicate their alertness levels to each other, and thus coordinate their sleep schedules..        This might be part of a more general phenomenon of unconscious signals that serve to synchronize group behavior, the authors of the Neuroimage paper wrote. ??Such synchronization could be essen","NLTKTokens":["finnish","government","recently","funded","brain","scanning","study","results","turned","hard-to-interpret","possible","clues","confirmed","obvious","yawn","contagion","largely","unconscious","wherever","might","affect","brain","bypasses","known","brain","circuitry","consciously","analyzing","mimicking","people","actions","circuitry","called","mirror-neuron","system","contains","special","type","brain","cells","neurons","become","active","owner","something","senses","someone","else","thing","mirror","neurons","typically","become","active","person","consciously","imitates","action","someone","else","process","associated","learning","seem","play","role","yawn","contagiousness","researchers","new","study","found","cells","extra","activity","contagious","yawning","compared","non-contagious","facial","movements","observed","brain","activity","associated","viewing","another","person","yawn","seems","circumvent","essential","parts","mns","mirror","neuron","system","line","nature","contagious","yawns","automatically","released","behavioural","acts???rather","truly","imitated","motor","patterns","would","require","detailed","action","understanding","wrote","researchers","helsinki","university","technology","research","centre","j??lich","germany","findings","published","february","issue","research","journal","neuroimage","seeing","someone","yawn","activate","centers","brain","researchers","found","appears","strongly","activate","least","brain","area","called","superior","temporal","sulcus","activation","unrelated","desire","yawn","response","may","irrelevant","contagion","question","researchers","added","possibly","significant","wrote","apparent","deactivation","second","brain","area","called","left","periamygdalar","region","strongly","participant","reported","wanting","yawn","response","another","person","yawn","stronger","deactivation","finding","represents","first","known","neurophysiological","signature","perceived","yawn","contagiousness","researchers","wrote","exactly","finding","means","less","clear","acknowledged","periamygdalar","region","zone","lies","alongside","amygdala","almond-shaped","structure","deep","brain","area","side","head","periamygdalar","region","linked","unconscious","analysis","emotional","expressions","faces","would","deactivated","tandem","yawn","contagion","unclear","researchers","said","thing","seems","clear","study","contagious","yawning","rely","brain","mechanisms","action","understanding","wrote","researchers","riitta","helsinki","university","technology","recent","email","rather","continued","seems","automatically","released","likely","archaic","motor","pattern","sequence","physical","actions","study","volunteers","looked","videos","actors","yawning","making","mouth","movements","meanwhile","brains","scanned","using","functional","magnetic","resonance","imaging","system","shows","amount","activity","work","going","various","brain","areas","based","amount","oxygen","used","volunteers","later","asked","strongly","tempted","yawn","viewing","pictures","apart","physical","brain","mechanisms","yawn","contagiousness","researchers","offered","different","reasons","exists","proposed","early","humans","yawn","contagiousness","might","helped","people","communicate","alertness","levels","thus","coordinate","sleep","schedules","might","part","general","phenomenon","unconscious","signals","serve","synchronize","group","behavior","authors","neuroimage","paper","wrote","synchronization","could","essen"]}

{"ID":31236583,"ABSTRACT":"What is strep throat?. Strep throat is a bacterial infection of the tissues in the back of the throat and the tonsils. The tissues become irritated and inflamed, causing a sudden, severe sore throat.. . What causes strep throat?. Strep throat is caused by streptococcal (strep) bacteria. There are many different strains of strep bacteria, some of which cause more serious illness than others. The type of strep that most commonly infects the throat is called group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABS).. . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. . Strep throat is most common in the late fall, winter, and early spring. The infection is spread by person-to-person contact with nasal secretions or saliva, often among family or household members.. . People with strep throat get sick an average of 3 days after they are exposed. (The range is 2\"5 days.) The illness usually begins suddenly, with a fever that peaks on the second day. Many also have sore throat, headache, stomachache, nausea, or chills.. . In some people, strep throat is very mild, with only a few of these symptoms. In others, strep throat is severe. There are many strains of strep. Some strains produce toxins that can lead to a scarlet fever rash. This rash is thought to be an allergic reaction to these toxins. Untreated, strep throat can sometimes lead to rheumatic fever.

{"ID":31236584,"ABSTRACT":"(m). . Strep throat is an infection caused by group A streptococcus bacteria, and it's very common among kids and teens. The symptoms of strep throat include fever, stomach pain, and red, swollen tonsils.. . Strep throat usually requires treatment with antibiotics. With the proper medical care - along with plenty of rest and fluids - your child should be back to school and play within a few days.. . Diagnosing Strep Throat . If your child's throat is sore and he or she has other strep throat symptoms, it's a good idea to call your child's doctor. The doctor will likely do a rapid strep test in the office, using a cotton swab to take a sample of the fluids at the back of your child's throat. The test only takes about 5 minutes. If it's positive, your child has strep throat. If the test is negative, the doctor will send a sample to a lab for a throat culture. The results are usually available within a few days.. . Treating Strep Throat. In most cases, doctors prescribe about 10 days of antibiotic medication to treat strep throat. Within about 24 hours after your child starts taking the antibiotics, his or her temperature will probably be back to normal, and your child will no longer be contagious. By the second or third day after taking antibiotics, the other symptoms should start to go away, too. . . Even though your child may not feel sick at that point, it's very important that he or she finish the antibiotic prescription. If your child stops taking antibiotics too soon, bacteria can remain in the throat and the symptoms can return.. . If your child is not treated for strep throat, he or she is most infectious when the symptoms are the most severe but could remain contagious for up to 21 days. Lack of treatment - or not finishing the prescribed course of antibiotics - also could put your child at risk for other health problems, such as rheumatic fever (which can cause permanent damage to the heart), scarlet fever, blood infections, or kidney disease.. . To prevent your sick child from spreading strep throat to others in your home, keep his or her eating utensils, dishes, and drinking glasses separate from those that everyone else is using. Wash them in hot, soapy water after each use. Also, make sure your child doesn't share food, drinks, napkins, handkerchiefs, or towels with other family members. Make sure your child covers his or her mouth and nose during a sneeze or a cough to prevent passing infectious fluid droplets to someone else.. . Caring for Your Child With Strep Throat. There's plenty you can do to help your child feel better. To prevent dehydration, make sure your child drinks plenty of cool liquids, such as water or ginger ale, especially if he or she has had a fever. Avoid orange juice, grapefruit juice, lemonade, or other acidic beverages, which may irritate your child's throat. Warm liquids like soups, tea with honey, or hot chocolate can be soothing.. . As your child starts to feel better, talk to your child's doctor about the best time to return to school and other routine activities.","NLTKTokens":["strep","throat","infection","caused","group","streptococcus","bacteria","common","among","kids","teens","symptoms","strep","throat","include","fever","stomach","pain","red","swollen","tonsils","strep","throat","usually","requires","treatment","antibiotics","proper","medical","along","plenty","rest","fluids","child","back","school","play","within","days","diagnosing","strep","throat","child","throat","sore","strep","throat","symptoms","good","idea","call","child","doctor","doctor","likely","rapid","strep","test","office","using","cotton","swab","sample","fluids","back","child","throat","test","takes","minutes","positive","child","strep","throat","test","negative","doctor","send","sample","lab","throat","culture","results","usually","available","within","days","treating","strep","throat","cases","doctors","prescribe","days","antibiotic","medication","treat","strep","throat","within","hours","child","starts","taking","antibiotics","temperature","probably","back","normal","child","longer","contagious","second","third","day","taking","antibiotics","symptoms","start","go","away","even","though","child","may","feel","sick","point","important","finish","antibiotic","prescription","child","stops","taking","antibiotics","soon","bacteria","remain","throat","symptoms","return","child","treated","strep","throat","infectious","symptoms","severe","could","remain","contagious","days","lack","treatment","finishing","prescribed","course","antibiotics","could","put","child","risk","health","problems","rheumatic","fever","cause","permanent","damage","heart","scarlet","fever","blood","infections","kidney","disease","prevent","sick","child","spreading","strep","throat","others","home","keep","eating","utensils","dishes","drinking","glasses","separate","everyone","else","using","wash","hot","soapy","water","use","make","sure","child","n't","share","food","drinks","napkins","handkerchiefs","towels","family","members","make","sure","child","covers","mouth","nose","sneeze","cough","prevent","passing","infectious","fluid","droplets","someone","else","caring","child","strep","throat","plenty","help","child","feel","better","prevent","dehydration","make","sure","child","drinks","plenty","cool","liquids","water","ginger","especially","fever","avoid","orange","juice","grapefruit","juice","lemonade","acidic","beverages","may","irritate","child","throat","warm","liquids","like","soups","tea","honey","hot","chocolate","soothing","child","starts","feel","better","talk","child","doctor","best","time","return","school","routine","activities"]}

{"ID":2715920,"ABSTRACT":"initial symptoms of \"mono\" are:. . a general lack of energy or malaise, . a loss of appetite, and . chills. . These initial symptoms can last from one to three days before the more intense symptoms of the illness begin. The more common intense symptoms include:. . a severe sore throat, . fever, and . swollen glands (lymph nodes) in the neck area. . It is generally the severe sore throat that prompts people to contact their doctor. . . What are the signs of \"mono?\" . . In addition to a fever from 102 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit, the most common signs of \"mono\" are:. . a very reddened throat and tonsils and . swollen lymph glands in the neck. . The tonsils have a whitish coating in at least one third of the cases. The spleen, (sometimes referred to as the body's biggest lymph node), is an organ found in the left upper abdomen underneath the ribcage which becomes enlarged or swollen in about 50% of patients with \"mono.\" An enlarged liver may also occur. About 5% of patients have a splotchy red rash over the body, which has a similar appearance to the rash of measles. . . How is \"mono\" diagnosed? . . The diagnosis of \"mono\" is suspected by the doctor based on the above symptoms and signs. \"Mono\" is confirmed by blood tests while testing to exclude other possible causes of the symptoms. Early in the course of the illness, blood tests show an increase in a type of white blood cell (lymphocyte). Some of these increased lymphocytes are unusual or \"atypical\" lymphocytes, which suggest \"mono.\" More specific testing, such as the monospot and heterophile antibody tests, can confirm the diagnosis of \"mono.\" These tests rely on the body's immune system to make measurable antibodies against the EBV. Unfortunately, the antibodies may not become detectable until the second or third weeks of the illness. A blood chemistry test can reveal abnormalities in liver function. Testing to exclude the possibility of a strep throat is also considered for some patients.","NLTKTokens":["initial","symptoms","mono","general","lack","energy","malaise","loss","appetite","chills","initial","symptoms","last","three","days","intense","symptoms","illness","begin","common","intense","symptoms","include","severe","sore","throat","fever","swollen","glands","lymph","nodes","neck","area","generally","severe","sore","throat","prompts","people","contact","doctor","signs","mono","addition","fever","degrees","fahrenheit","common","signs","mono","reddened","throat","tonsils","swollen","lymph","glands","neck","tonsils","whitish","coating","least","third","cases","spleen","sometimes","referred","body","biggest","lymph","node","organ","found","left","upper","abdomen","underneath","ribcage","becomes","enlarged","swollen","patients","mono","enlarged","liver","may","occur","patients","splotchy","red","rash","body","similar","appearance","rash","measles","mono","diagnosed","diagnosis","mono","suspected","doctor","based","symptoms","signs","mono","confirmed","blood","tests","testing","exclude","possible","causes","symptoms","early","course","illness","blood","tests","show","increase","type","white","blood","cell","lymphocyte","increased","lymphocytes","unusual","atypical","lymphocytes","suggest","mono","specific","testing","monospot","heterophile","antibody","tests","confirm","diagnosis","mono","tests","rely","body","immune","system","make","measurable","antibodies","ebv","unfortunately","antibodies","may","become","detectable","second","third","weeks","illness","blood","chemistry","test","reveal","abnormalities","liver","function","testing","exclude","possibility","strep","throat","considered","patients"]}

{"ID":17578740,"ABSTRACT":"Hate to break your Easter egg, but \"Easter Sunday\" is not truly redundant, but rather a clarification for more precise language.  . . Easter:  Easter is a more generic term that can apply to the entire season of the church year that lasts fifty days.  The term, \"Easter Sunday\" would therefore be the precise method of designating which day of the fifty day period we are talking about, much as \"Christmas Day\" designates December 25 from the more generic Christmas season. (Beginning to look a lot like \"Christmas\", \"Christmas\" time, getting ready for \"Christmas\", etc.). . As for 12 noon and 12 midnight, this is probably more a function of the need for colloquial redundancy in our spoken language (yes, I realize that was redundant) and also the fact that we are often designating morning or evening for the times we give -- 3 in the afternoon, 3 in the morning, so we act out of habit.  Much of our language is redundant so that we can effectively communicate.  Just think how small the information of this paragraph actually is when reduced electronically because of its redundancy.  It doesn't mean that I should type this out in ones and zeros however.  Information theory has exposed just how redundant our language is and how important reduncancy is for accuracy and clarity.. . As for the hot water heater, you probably never took a science class or you would realize that thermodynamics requires the hot water to be heated or it will get cold.. . Oh and one more thing, I'm a proponent of redundancy since it enhances clarity, but isn't it redundant to write the following:  \"Either midnight or noon will suffice, I'm well aware that it's 12 either way.\"  You could have said: \"Either midnight or noon will suffice.\" or \"I'm well aware that it's 12 either way.\"  Aren't those pretty much the same thing?. .

When one is baptized, one is baptized into Christ's death, simulating his death and burial, and then raised up to walk in newness of life, simulating his resurrection (ROMANS 6:3,4; COLOSSIANS 2:12).

Being \"born again\" doesn't refer to the physical rebirth, but the spiritual rebirth, and doesn't refer to reincarnation.

Hundreds of instantly cured hiccuper's have sent in their testimony's of deliverance! Files are available for researchers! Carefully understand both the HOW and the WHY of this method. If you don't get the WHY you might not get the HOW. Here's how to cure the hiccups:. . \"Hughes/Green Hiccups Cure\"?? 1997. . (1) Pour a TALL glass of water.. . (2) Hold your breath... ***. . (3) IMPORTANT...PINCH YOUR NOSE CLOSED.. . (4) Slowly, take 10 - 20 swallows of the water...while holding your breath with your nose pinched closed.. . (5) When you can't stand it any more....you'll know by that overwhelming drowning sensation -- after a gasp, take a deep breath and relax.. . This cures the hiccups 99 percent of the time - guaranteed! It's a proven medical remedy! (A second treatment could be necessary for stubborn cases.). . *** For stubborn cases, try EXHALING COMPLETELY and then taking 10 - 20 swallows.. . NOW: HERE'S WHY IT WORKS: Hiccups are caused by an uncontrollable spasm in the diaphragm, (the \"breathing\" muscle). Often, this spasm is triggered by irritable conditions in the smooth muscles of the stomach or the esophagus. The \"Hughes/Green Hiccups Cure\" forces an increase in the carbon dioxide levels in the diaphragm itself, as well as in the stomach and esophagus. By swallowing, you are making the muscles work -- so they use up their available oxygen and replace it with carbon dioxide. By temporarily discontinuing to breath, you prohibit new oxygen from entering your body and thus create an anaerobic condition in the spasming diaphragm muscle. When the spasming diaphragm and stomach are deprived temporarily of oxygen and encounter the higher levels of carbon dioxide ... you feel that scary drowning sensation! BUT this causes the spasming muscles to relax! The hiccups go away! Essentially, you are \"tricking\" your body into thinking that it's drowning ... and it decides to use it's resources for something other than hiccuping. The rather \"scary\" drowning sensation caused by this method is NECESSARY for the method to work. If it's not just a little bit difficult ... it doesn't work.","NLTKTokens":["real","way","instantly","cure","hiccups","look","hughes/green","method","cure","hiccups","every","time","guaranteed","amazed","hundreds","instantly","cured","hiccuper","sent","testimony","deliverance","files","available","researchers","carefully","understand","method","n't","get","might","get","cure","hiccups","hughes/green","hiccups","cure","tall","glass","water","hold","breath","important","pinch","nose","closed","slowly","swallows","water","holding","breath","nose","pinched","closed","n't","stand","know","overwhelming","drowning","sensation","gasp","deep","breath","relax","cures","hiccups","percent","time","guaranteed","proven","medical","remedy","second","treatment","could","necessary","stubborn","cases","stubborn","cases","try","exhaling","completely","taking","swallows","works","hiccups","caused","uncontrollable","spasm","diaphragm","breathing","muscle","often","spasm","triggered","irritable","conditions","smooth","muscles","stomach","esophagus","hughes/green","hiccups","cure","forces","increase","carbon","dioxide","levels","diaphragm","well","stomach","esophagus","swallowing","making","muscles","work","use","available","oxygen","replace","carbon","dioxide","temporarily","discontinuing","breath","prohibit","new","oxygen","entering","body","thus","create","anaerobic","condition","spasming","diaphragm","muscle","spasming","diaphragm","stomach","deprived","temporarily","oxygen","encounter","higher","levels","carbon","dioxide","feel","scary","drowning","sensation","causes","spasming","muscles","relax","hiccups","go","away","essentially","tricking","body","thinking","drowning","decides","use","resources","something","hiccuping","rather","scary","drowning","sensation","caused","method","necessary","method","work","little","bit","difficult","n't","work"]}

{"ID":26962991,"ABSTRACT":"This is not a question, but a rhetorical bit of propaganda.  Nevertheless, the Middle East situation is the key background info that most Americans do not really appreciate:  I recommend the Academy Award Winning movie Lawrence of Arabia for a better understanding of why we Americans have so many enemies in the Arab world.. . OK:  your question is both incredibly stupid and, when looked at deeper, incredibly deep and important.. . First, let's get incredibly stupid out of the way.  Since both the Arabs and the Jews but especially the Arabs are guilty of murder in that part of the world,  the question is definitely stupid . . . HOWEVER . . . .. . What most Americans do NOT realize is where all that Arab hate came from.  Let me explain that hate:  visually!!!  I live in Colorado, and in case you haven't looked at a map recently, Colorado is one of the largest states among the 50.  Eighth largest between larger Nevada and smaller Oregon.  So if you're looking at a map of the western USA and see the Rocky Mountains running north to south through Colorado, imagine everything 69 miles east of the Rockies being taken away from the Colorado people and given to another group and the name of that place being changed to \"New Israel.\"  I think you can guarantee that for untold history, the former inhabitants would hate and resent all the occupants of New Israel.  That's exactly what was done in 1947 when Israel was created out of Arab land.  Jews had not lived in that area in any significant numbers for many long centuries, but out of guilt for not having done anything sooner (Hitler began tormenting German Jews as early as 1933) Europe and the USA eventually stood behind the Jewish state.  That's where the hate comes from and that's why the hate will not end ever.. .   If you also watch Lawrence of Arabia, you'll see that the lies of the British and French to the Arabs were about like the promises of the White legislators to the Indians during America's westward expansion.  That's why we are so mistrusted because we aligned ourselves always with the British.. .   So, stupid question but the hate beneath it, needs to be understood.","NLTKTokens":["question","rhetorical","bit","propaganda","nevertheless","middle","east","situation","key","background","info","americans","really","appreciate","recommend","academy","award","winning","movie","lawrence","arabia","better","understanding","americans","many","enemies","arab","world","ok","question","incredibly","stupid","looked","deeper","incredibly","deep","important","first","let","get","incredibly","stupid","way","since","arabs","jews","especially","arabs","guilty","murder","part","world","question","definitely","stupid","however","americans","realize","arab","hate","came","let","explain","hate","visually","live","colorado","case","n't","looked","map","recently","colorado","largest","states","among","eighth","largest","larger","nevada","smaller","oregon","looking","map","western","usa","see","rocky","mountains","running","north","south","colorado","imagine","everything","miles","east","rockies","taken","away","colorado","people","given","another","group","place","changed","new","israel","think","guarantee","untold","history","former","inhabitants","would","hate","resent","occupants","new","israel","exactly","done","israel","created","arab","land","jews","lived","area","significant","numbers","many","long","centuries","guilt","done","anything","sooner","hitler","began","tormenting","german","jews","early","europe","usa","eventually","stood","behind","jewish","state","hate","comes","hate","ever","watch","lawrence","arabia","see","lies","british","french","arabs","like","promises","white","legislators","indians","america","westward","expansion","mistrusted","aligned","always","british","stupid","question","hate","beneath","needs","understood"]}

{"ID":23699270,"ABSTRACT":"Today it is just  a fun tradition to color Easter Eggs  - historically:. . Intricate Easter egg designs date back centuries. The decoration of Easter eggs to further enhance their value became an art form centuries ago and continues today. Dyes made from vegetables, edible flowers, fruits, coffee, tea, leaves, bark, and roots were used to tint the eggs. Lovely designs were created by wrapping the eggs in ferns before tinting. The art progressed, with western Europeans becoming expert at creating intricate patterns in vibrant colors on the small eggs. . . Here are explanations of some of the many types of decorated eggs: . . ??? Etched: Traced back to Macedonia, this process involves dying the egg, applying a layer of wax in a design, then bleaching off the color leaving only the wax-covered areas with color.. . ??? Krashanky: The Ukrainian word means color, and these eggs are dyed a solid, brilliant color, often red to symbolize the blood shed by Christ on the cross.. . ??? Faberg??: Probably some of the most famous and most expensive Easter eggs known are those created by Russian jeweler Peter Carl Faberg?? in the 1800's. The eggs were made of gold, silver and jewels and most opened up to reveal exquisite tiny figures of people, animals, plants or buildings. A total of 57 eggs were made. These are obviously museum artifacts of high value.. . ??? Jeweled: Designs are created by gluing any manner of sequins, beads, flowers, etc., onto blown eggs.. . ??? Cut-Out or Carved: Blown eggs are used also for these creations where a portion of the shell is cut away. The exterior is decorated, and the inside filled with a little scene to be viewed through the cut-out section. These can be exquisitely elaborate.","NLTKTokens":["today","fun","tradition","color","easter","eggs","historically","intricate","easter","egg","designs","date","back","centuries","decoration","easter","eggs","enhance","value","became","art","form","centuries","ago","continues","today","dyes","made","vegetables","edible","flowers","fruits","coffee","tea","leaves","bark","roots","used","tint","eggs","lovely","designs","created","wrapping","eggs","ferns","tinting","art","progressed","western","europeans","becoming","expert","creating","intricate","patterns","vibrant","colors","small","eggs","explanations","many","types","decorated","eggs","etched","traced","back","macedonia","process","involves","dying","egg","applying","layer","wax","design","bleaching","color","leaving","wax-covered","areas","color","krashanky","ukrainian","word","means","color","eggs","dyed","solid","brilliant","color","often","red","symbolize","blood","shed","christ","cross","faberg??","probably","famous","expensive","easter","eggs","known","created","russian","jeweler","carl","faberg??","eggs","made","gold","silver","jewels","opened","reveal","exquisite","tiny","figures","people","animals","plants","buildings","total","eggs","made","obviously","museum","artifacts","high","value","jeweled","designs","created","gluing","manner","sequins","beads","flowers","etc","onto","blown","eggs","cut-out","carved","blown","eggs","used","creations","portion","shell","cut","away","exterior","decorated","inside","filled","little","scene","viewed","cut-out","section","exquisitely","elaborate"]}

He continually asks his guests??? one simple question: \"How's it working for you?\". . Success in anything comes from FINDING WHAT WORKS then DOING WHAT WORKS.. . I am going to reveal to you the Secret Weight Loss Formula that Celebrity personal trainer don't want you to know about.. . Before I reveal the secret, first I need to explain to you that there is process that your body goes through to burn body fat. . . So how does your body burn fat?. . It is a two steps process and in order to lose body fat you need to:. . 1.Release the fat from the fat cells and only then. 2.You can burn the fat. . How does your body release the fat from the cells?. . Before you can turn your body into a fat burning machine, here what needs to happen: your body fat need to be released from the fat cells. You can accomplish this step successfully with your nutrition program. Here are some specific tips that you can apply right away to achieve that.. . 1.Eat 4-6 small, frequent meals and never skip meals.. 2.Eat natural foods; avoid processed & refined foods. 3.Eat lean proteins with each meal.. 4.Eat more complex carbs, fruits & vegetables.. 5.Drink plenty of water. . . How does your body burn the fat? . . If you started exercising and then reached a plateau, you have probably burned more muscle tissue than fat with your workout. This is the worst thing that could happen.. . Let me explain. . . Less Muscle = slower metabolism = Weight loss plateau. Then you end up in the yo-yo dieting bandwagon.. . How to burn the *fat* instead of burning muscles.. . You need to do some MODERATE cardio training. The key word here is moderate. . Doing too much cardio can be detrimental and I am sure you have seen those people that are doing cardio on a daily basis and still not getting anywhere. The result is a low metabolism. Low metabolism means, your body fat is not going anywhere, anytime . soon. Here is what you need to do:. . 1.Do some moderate cardio training; the key word here is moderate. 2.Never diet but consume little fewer calories that you will burn (No starvation diets, Please...). . Your muscle tissue is your best friend when it comes to burn body fat. You need to preserve muscle tissues in order to keep losing weight. Most people go on a starvation diet combined a lot of cardio to lose weight. At first it may seems like this is working because they are losing scale weight. . . Now think about, scale weight does not tell you if weight loss is from fat, water or muscle tissue. Scale weight by itself is not a good indicator of success.. . To maintain muscle tissues you need to:. 1.Do some resistance training. (This is not optional, it is mandatory). . . The secret. . Now that you understand the whole fat burning process, I am going to reveal to you how celebrity personal trainers do to get those amazing transformations. The strategy is to combine all the steps that I outlined so the body works as a unit.  First, the trainer makes sure that his client is eating the proper food on a regular basis. . . By that, I mean eating so that fat WILL be released from the fat cells. Then and only then they exercise the body to burn the fat. The important idea to take from this is:. . \"The fat can ONLY be burned after it is released from the fat cells\".. . If you know anybody that has been exercising like a maniac and they don't seem to go anywhere, now you know why.. . The reverse is also true, do you know somebody that is eating properly but they are not including any resistance training combined with moderate cardio. Now you know why their body still looks the same.. . All you need to do is to combine a nutrition program, along with some MODERATE cardio program and maintain muscle mass with resistance training. Everything is combined with one goal in mind: Turning your body into an Automatic fat burning machine. It is that easy.. .

When the  certain molecules vibrate at the same frequency (speed, size) as a specific type of light, the molecules will absorb that light and either reflect it or release it as heat (usually a combination).  . High energy UV light is bad for your eyes, but visible spectrum light is necessary to see.  Sunglasses are composed of materials that absorb/reflect light in the UV spectrum but allow visible light to pass through to you eyes.  Typically some of the visible light is absorbed as well, which is why the world appears in a different color or is darker.  . . To give an example, purple light is very similar in wavelength to UV light, so it would to be a huge stretch to find that your UV filtering sunglasses also filter purple light.  B/c colors are a mixture of light, all of the colors that you look at would be without purple, which would change their color as you see it.","NLTKTokens":["light","thought","wave","different","types","light","different","size","waves","atoms","molecules","vibrate","wave-like","fashion","certain","molecules","vibrate","frequency","speed","size","specific","type","light","molecules","absorb","light","either","reflect","release","heat","usually","combination","high","energy","uv","light","bad","eyes","visible","spectrum","light","necessary","see","sunglasses","composed","materials","absorb/reflect","light","uv","spectrum","allow","visible","light","pass","eyes","typically","visible","light","absorbed","well","world","appears","different","color","darker","give","example","purple","light","similar","wavelength","uv","light","would","huge","stretch","find","uv","filtering","sunglasses","filter","purple","light","b/c","colors","mixture","light","colors","look","would","without","purple","would","change","color","see"]}

{"ID":6234032,"ABSTRACT":"STD has various types...and you cant just take any medicines to treat it. you have to see a doctor for a proper treatment if you wanna live longer.  prolong exposure to std will/might develope HIV due to prolong infection in your body so its up to you.....:). . . Sexually transmitted diseases, commonly called STDs, are infections that are spread by having sex with someone who has an STD. You can get a sexually transmitted disease from sexual activity that involves the mouth, anus or vagina.. . STDs are serious illnesses that require treatment, regardless of whether or not you are pregnant. But, when you are pregnant, you are not the only one at risk; many STDs can be especially harmful to you and your baby. Some STDs, like HIV/AIDS, cannot be cured and are deadly.. . Your health care provider will likely screen for some STDs at your first prenatal visit , but if you have sex with someone who is infected, you will need to be screened at subsequent appointments and treated. If you suspect you have an STD, be sure to tell your doctor immediately. Fast treatment is the best way to protect you and your baby.. . STDs include:. .     * Herpes.     * HIV/AIDS.     * Genital warts (caused by human papilloma virus, or HPV).     * Hepatitis B.     * Chlamydia.     * Syphilis.     * Gonorrhea.     * Vaginitis . . What Are the Symptoms of STDs?. . Sometimes, there are no symptoms. If symptoms are present, they may include:. .     * Bumps, sores or warts near the mouth, anus, penis or vagina.     * Swelling or redness near the penis or vagina.     * Skin rash.     * Painful urination.     * Weight loss, loose stool, night sweats.     * Aches, pains, fever and chills.     * Yellowing of the skin (jaundice).     * Discharge from the penis or vagina (vaginal discharge may have an odor).     * Bleeding from the vagina other than during a monthly period.     * Painful sex.     * Severe itching near the penis or vagina. . How Can I Find Out If I Have an STD?. . At your prenatal visit, your health care provider will screen for a number of STDs. But, if you think you have an STD, tell your provider. He or she can examine you and perform other tests to determine if you have a sexually transmitted disease.. . How Can I Protect Myself From STDs?. . Here are some basic steps that you can take to protect yourself from contracting STDs:. .     * Consider that not having sex is the only sure way to prevent STDs..     * Use a latex condom every time you have sex. (If you use a lubricant, make sure it is water-based.).     * Limit your number of sexual partners. The more partners you have the more likely you are to catch an STD..     * Practice monogamy. This means having sex with only one person. That person must also have sex with only you to reduce your risk..     * Choose your sex partners with care. Don't have sex with someone whom you suspect may have an STD..     * Get checked for STDs. Don't risk giving the infection to someone else or your baby. Just because you've been screened for STDs early on in your pregnancy, does not mean that you can't contract one later during your pregnancy. If you engage in unprotected sex with more than one partner since your last STD screen, you need another set of screening tests. Also, you should be concerned if your partner is having unprotected sex with other people..     * If you have more than one sex partner, always use a condom..     * Don't use alcohol or drugs before you have sex. You may be less likely to practice safe sex if you are drunk or high. Plus, alcohol and drugs can harm your developing baby..     * Know the signs and symptoms of STDs. Look for them in yourself and your sex partners..     * Learn about STDs. The more you know about STDs, the better you can protect yourself.. . How Can I Prevent Spreading a STD?. .     * Stop having sex until you see a health care provider and are treated..     * Follow your health care provider's instructions for treatment..     * Use condom","NLTKTokens":["std","various","types","cant","medicines","treat","see","doctor","proper","treatment","wan","live","longer","prolong","exposure","std","will/might","develope","hiv","due","prolong","infection","body","sexually","transmitted","diseases","commonly","called","stds","infections","spread","sex","someone","std","get","sexually","transmitted","disease","sexual","activity","involves","mouth","anus","vagina","stds","serious","illnesses","require","treatment","regardless","whether","pregnant","pregnant","risk","many","stds","especially","harmful","baby","stds","like","hiv/aids","cured","deadly","health","provider","likely","screen","stds","first","prenatal","visit","sex","someone","infected","need","screened","subsequent","appointments","treated","suspect","std","sure","tell","doctor","immediately","fast","treatment","best","way","protect","baby","stds","include","herpes","hiv/aids","genital","warts","caused","human","papilloma","virus","hpv","hepatitis","chlamydia","syphilis","gonorrhea","vaginitis","symptoms","stds","sometimes","symptoms","symptoms","present","may","include","bumps","sores","warts","near","mouth","anus","penis","vagina","swelling","redness","near","penis","vagina","skin","rash","painful","urination","weight","loss","loose","stool","night","sweats","aches","pains","fever","chills","yellowing","skin","jaundice","discharge","penis","vagina","vaginal","discharge","may","odor","bleeding","vagina","monthly","period","painful","sex","severe","itching","near","penis","vagina","find","std","prenatal","visit","health","provider","screen","number","stds","think","std","tell","provider","examine","perform","tests","determine","sexually","transmitted","disease","protect","stds","basic","steps","protect","contracting","stds","consider","sex","sure","way","prevent","stds","use","latex","condom","every","time","sex","use","lubricant","make","sure","water-based","limit","number","sexual","partners","partners","likely","catch","std","practice","monogamy","means","sex","person","person","must","sex","reduce","risk","choose","sex","partners","n't","sex","someone","suspect","may","std","get","checked","stds","n't","risk","giving","infection","someone","else","baby","screened","stds","early","pregnancy","mean","n't","contract","later","pregnancy","engage","unprotected","sex","partner","since","last","std","screen","need","another","set","screening","tests","concerned","partner","unprotected","sex","people","sex","partner","always","use","condom","n't","use","alcohol","drugs","sex","may","less","likely","practice","safe","sex","drunk","high","plus","alcohol","drugs","harm","developing","baby","know","signs","symptoms","stds","look","sex","partners","learn","stds","know","stds","better","protect","prevent","spreading","std","stop","sex","see","health","provider","treated","follow","health","provider","instructions","treatment","use","condom"]}

{"ID":44827033,"ABSTRACT":"Changes in catalase (CAT) activity and in CAT isoform pattern and expression were investigated in developing sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) seeds during desiccation on the mother plant and after artificial drying on the flowerheads. Seeds regularly desiccated during their development on the mother plant and reached mass maturity at c. 42 d after flowering (DAF). Freshly harvested seeds did not germinate at any stage of development because they were dormant, but their dormancy was broken after 5???6 months of dry storage. Immature seeds were desiccation-tolerant at 24 DAF since they were able to germinate fully after artificial drying on the flowerheads followed by dry storage. CAT activity increased in non-dehydrated seeds during their development, reaching a maximum a little after seed mass maturity and after artificial drying in immature seeds. This stimulation of CAT activity by natural and artificial drying was related to changes in CAT isoform pattern. Of the four constitutive CAT subunits, that of 59 kDa was always present, but dehydration induced the synthesis of a 55 kDa subunit. This synthesis of the CAT 55 kDa subunit resulted from an activation of the CATA1 gene, suggesting that the regulation of catalase activity and synthesis by drying occurred at the transcriptional level. The increase in CAT activity induced by seed drying was associated with a decrease in hydrogen peroxide level and in lipid peroxidation. These results suggest that CAT plays a role during seed desiccation by preventing dehydration-related oxidative damage and that H2O2 may play a role in the regulation of CAT gene expression and the transduction pathway of the dehydration signal.","NLTKTokens":["changes","catalase","activity","isoform","pattern","expression","investigated","developing","sunflower","helianthus","annuus","seeds","desiccation","mother","plant","artificial","drying","flowerheads","seeds","regularly","desiccated","development","mother","plant","reached","mass","maturity","flowering","daf","freshly","harvested","seeds","germinate","stage","development","dormant","dormancy","broken","months","dry","storage","immature","seeds","desiccation-tolerant","daf","since","able","germinate","fully","artificial","drying","flowerheads","followed","dry","storage","activity","increased","non-dehydrated","seeds","development","reaching","maximum","little","seed","mass","maturity","artificial","drying","immature","seeds","stimulation","activity","natural","artificial","drying","related","changes","isoform","pattern","four","constitutive","subunits","kda","always","present","dehydration","induced","synthesis","kda","subunit","synthesis","kda","subunit","resulted","activation","gene","suggesting","regulation","catalase","activity","synthesis","drying","occurred","transcriptional","level","increase","activity","induced","seed","drying","associated","decrease","hydrogen","peroxide","level","lipid","peroxidation","results","suggest","plays","role","seed","desiccation","preventing","dehydration-related","oxidative","damage","may","play","role","regulation","gene","expression","transduction","pathway","dehydration","signal"]}

{"ID":33890387,"ABSTRACT":"Living in the UK, I am lucky that that a lot of our media is prepared to take a broader view on topics. Certainly, there are a lot of examples of the British media taking time out to explore Islamic culture and to try and portray a more accurate view of lifestyle and culture.. . In the sources below, I post a link to a radio documentary broadcast on BBC last weekend which I believe provides an in-depth and objective view on the topic. It's two hours and has some fluffy stuff before the programme, but well worth listening to.. . However, the media will report news. A group of Arabs sitting in a coffee shop discussing philosophy isn't news and won't get reported.. .  Agroup of muslims taking to the streets of London demanding that a cartoonist be executed for drawing some pictures is news. It also runs against the culture of fairness and free speech that is the core of our democracy - so it is certainly going to portray Islam in a bad light.. . The Western culture has a very different way of undertaking protest. It tends to be non-violent and based around debate. Yet whenever we see Islamic protests they seem to involve threats or actual violence, flag burning and intimidation.. . In the case of the London protests, these were not born out of fruistration at not being able to make a point - these were the first instincts of protest.. . You see, Islam and the Arabs have a real image problem in the West.

An engine can make more power with the same amount of fuel if it can get more air(or specifically oxygen) into the combustion chamber and then vent that gas. Turbochargers and superchargers force more air into the intake of a motor. Some manufacturers these days are favoring the turbocharger because it is \"free energy\" since it runs off the exhaust gases where as a supercharger usually runs off the serpentine belt in effect making the engine work harder than it would without the supercharger. In the end, car manufacturers have started using more turbochargers these days to get better fuel mileage out of that vehicle and sell more cars to make more money.","NLTKTokens":["volumetric","efficiency","key","producing","power","internal","combustion","engine","volumetric","efficiency","engine","make","power","amount","fuel","get","air","specifically","oxygen","combustion","chamber","vent","gas","turbochargers","superchargers","force","air","intake","motor","manufacturers","days","favoring","turbocharger","free","energy","since","runs","exhaust","gases","supercharger","usually","runs","serpentine","belt","effect","making","engine","work","harder","would","without","supercharger","car","manufacturers","started","using","turbochargers","days","get","better","fuel","mileage","vehicle","sell","cars","make","money"]}

{"ID":4893576,"ABSTRACT":"Mary I, the queen of England from 1553 to 1558 became known as \"Bloody Mary\" during the reign of her successor, Elizabeth on account of the perceived ferocity of her religious persecutions; she has borne the epithet ever since. \"Bloody Mary\" is also a name for a ghost or witch who appears in children's folklore; other very similar tales use different names.. . Several fictional characters are also called Bloody Mary. . In folklore and children's street culture, \"Bloody Mary\" is the name of a children's game in which a ghost or witch of the same name (or sometimes other names, such as Mary Worth) is said to appear in a mirror when summoned. One of the more common ways participants attempt to make her appear is to stand before a mirror in the dark and repeat her name three times, though there are many variations. Some include chanting a hundred times, chanting at midnight, spinning around, or rubbing one's eyes. Most of these are meant to disorient people. In some versions of the legend, the summoner must say \"Bloody Mary, I killed your son!\" (or \"I killed your baby\"). In these variants, Bloody Mary is often believed to be the spirit of a mother (often a widow) who murdered her children, or a woman who was murdered shortly before or after her wedding. In stories where Mary is supposed to have been wrongly accused of killing her children, the querent might say \"I believe in Mary Worth.\" This is similar to another game involving the summoning of The Bell Witch in a mirror at midnight. Similar rituals are also used to summon spirits in the movies Beetlejuice (1988) and Candyman (1992). The game is often a test of courage, as it is said that if Bloody Mary is summoned, she would murder the summoner, often in a quite violent way, such as gouging out his or her eyes. Other variations say that the querent must not look directly at her, but at her image in the mirror; she will then reveal the querent's future, particularly concerning marriage and children.. . Bloody Mary Worth is typically described as a child-murderess who lived in the locality where the legend has taken root about a century ago. There is often a specific local graveyard or tombstone that becomes attached to the legend.. . On the other hand, various people have surmised that the lore about taunting Bloody Mary about her baby may relate her tenuously to folklore about Queen Mary I. ([1], [2]) The queen's life was marked by a number of miscarriages or false pregnancies. Had Mary I successfully borne a child, this would have established a Roman Catholic succession and threatened the continuance of her religious persecutions after her death. Speculation exists that the miscarriages were deliberately induced. As a result, some retellings of the tale make Bloody Mary the queen driven to madness by the loss of her children. ([3]) It is likely, however, that Queen Mary I provided only her nickname to the Bloody Mary of folklore.. . She is also confused in some tellings of the story with Mary Queen of Scots. Bloody Mary is sometimes said to have bathed in the blood of her child victims in order to retain a youthful complexion; this would appear to confound her with Elizabeth B??thory.. . The mirror ritual by which Bloody Mary is summoned may also relate to a form of divination involving mirrors and darkness that was once performed on Halloween. While as with any sort of folklore the details may vary, this particular tale encouraged young women to walk up a flight of stairs backwards, holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, they were supposed to be able to catch a view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that they would see the skull-face of the Grim Reaper instead; this meant, of course, that they were destined to die before they married.","NLTKTokens":["mary","queen","england","became","known","bloody","mary","reign","successor","elizabeth","account","perceived","ferocity","religious","persecutions","borne","epithet","ever","since","bloody","mary","ghost","witch","appears","children","folklore","similar","tales","use","different","names","several","fictional","characters","called","bloody","mary","folklore","children","street","culture","bloody","mary","children","game","ghost","witch","sometimes","names","mary","worth","said","appear","mirror","summoned","common","ways","participants","attempt","make","appear","stand","mirror","dark","repeat","three","times","though","many","variations","include","chanting","hundred","times","chanting","midnight","spinning","around","rubbing","eyes","meant","disorient","people","versions","legend","summoner","must","say","bloody","mary","killed","killed","baby","variants","bloody","mary","often","believed","spirit","mother","often","widow","murdered","children","woman","murdered","shortly","wedding","stories","mary","supposed","wrongly","accused","killing","children","querent","might","say","believe","mary","worth","similar","another","game","involving","summoning","bell","witch","mirror","midnight","similar","rituals","used","summon","spirits","movies","beetlejuice","candyman","game","often","test","courage","said","bloody","mary","summoned","would","murder","summoner","often","quite","violent","way","gouging","eyes","variations","say","querent","must","look","directly","image","mirror","reveal","querent","future","particularly","concerning","marriage","children","bloody","mary","worth","typically","described","child-murderess","lived","locality","legend","taken","root","century","ago","often","specific","local","graveyard","tombstone","becomes","attached","legend","hand","various","people","surmised","lore","taunting","bloody","mary","baby","may","relate","tenuously","folklore","queen","mary","queen","life","marked","number","miscarriages","false","pregnancies","mary","successfully","borne","child","would","established","roman","catholic","succession","threatened","continuance","religious","persecutions","death","speculation","exists","miscarriages","deliberately","induced","result","retellings","make","bloody","mary","queen","driven","madness","loss","children","likely","however","queen","mary","provided","nickname","bloody","mary","folklore","confused","tellings","story","mary","queen","scots","bloody","mary","sometimes","said","bathed","blood","child","victims","order","retain","youthful","complexion","would","appear","confound","elizabeth","b??thory","mirror","ritual","bloody","mary","summoned","may","relate","form","divination","involving","mirrors","darkness","performed","halloween","sort","folklore","details","may","vary","particular","encouraged","young","women","walk","flight","stairs","backwards","holding","candle","hand","mirror","darkened","house","gazed","mirror","supposed","able","catch","view","future","husband","however","chance","would","see","skull-face","grim","reaper","instead","meant","course","destined","married"]}

{"ID":9718133,"ABSTRACT":"1) Anxiety:  . Anxiety is a complex combination of the feeling of fear, apprehension and worry often accompanied by physical sensations such as palpitations, chest pain and/or shortness of breath. It may exist as a primary brain disorder or may be associated with other medical problems including other psychiatric disorders.. . 2) Depression:. Depression (mood)  . Depression, in everyday language, refers to any downturn in mood, which may be relatively transitory and perhaps due to something trivial. This is differentiated from clinical depression which is marked by symptoms that last two weeks or more and are so severe that they interfere with daily living.. In the field of psychiatry the word depression can also have this meaning but more specifically refers to a mental illness when it has reached a severity and duration to warrant a diagnosis. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) states that a depressed mood is often reported as being: \"... depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, or 'down in the dumps'.\". .  Depression (geology)  . Depression in geology is a landform sunken or depressed below the surrounding area. Depressions may be formed by various mechanisms, and may be referred to by a variety of technical terms.. . Depression (economics)  . In economics, a depression is a term commonly used for a sustained downturn in the economy. It is more severe than a recession (which is seen as a normal downturn in the business cycle). Considered a rare but extreme form of recession, the start of a depression is characterised by unusual increases in unemployment, restriction of credit, shrinking output and investment, price deflation or hyperinflation, numerous bankruptcies, reduced amounts of trade and commerce, as well as violent currency devaluations. Unlike a recession, there is no official definition for a depression, even though some have been proposed. Generally it is marked by a substantial and sustained shortfall of the ability to purchase goods relative to the amount that could be produced given current resources and technology (potential output). One could say that while a recession refers to the economy \"falling down,\" a depression is a matter of \"not being able to get up.\" . . Depression (meteorology)  . A depression (also called a 'low') is an area of low pressure caused by rising air.. This is opposite to an anti-cyclone which is an area of high pressure.","NLTKTokens":["anxiety","anxiety","complex","combination","feeling","fear","apprehension","worry","often","accompanied","physical","sensations","palpitations","chest","pain","and/or","shortness","breath","may","exist","primary","brain","disorder","may","associated","medical","problems","including","psychiatric","disorders","depression","depression","mood","depression","everyday","language","refers","downturn","mood","may","relatively","transitory","perhaps","due","something","trivial","differentiated","clinical","depression","marked","symptoms","last","two","weeks","severe","interfere","daily","living","field","psychiatry","word","depression","meaning","specifically","refers","mental","illness","reached","severity","duration","warrant","diagnosis","diagnostic","statistical","manual","mental","disorders","dsm","states","depressed","mood","often","reported","depressed","sad","hopeless","discouraged","dumps","depression","geology","depression","geology","landform","sunken","depressed","surrounding","area","depressions","may","formed","various","mechanisms","may","referred","variety","technical","terms","depression","economics","economics","depression","term","commonly","used","sustained","downturn","economy","severe","recession","seen","normal","downturn","business","cycle","considered","rare","extreme","form","recession","start","depression","characterised","unusual","increases","unemployment","restriction","credit","shrinking","output","investment","price","deflation","hyperinflation","numerous","bankruptcies","reduced","amounts","trade","commerce","well","violent","currency","devaluations","unlike","recession","official","definition","depression","even","though","proposed","generally","marked","substantial","sustained","shortfall","ability","purchase","goods","relative","amount","could","produced","given","current","resources","technology","potential","output","could","say","recession","refers","economy","falling","depression","matter","able","get","depression","meteorology","depression","called","low","area","low","pressure","caused","rising","air","opposite","anti-cyclone","area","high","pressure"]}

{"ID":13766861,"ABSTRACT":"Have you ever watched someone try to cover up gray hair by dyeing it? Or maybe you wonder why your granddad has a full head of silver hair when in old pictures it used to be dark brown? Getting gray, silver, or white hair is a natural part of growing older, and here's why.. . Each hair on our heads is made up of two parts:. . a shaft - the colored part we see growing out of our heads . a root - the bottom part, which keeps the hair anchored under the scalp. The root of every strand of hair is surrounded by a tube of tissue under the skin that is called the hair follicle (say: fah-lih-kul). Each hair follicle contains a certain number of pigment cells. These pigment cells continuously produce a chemical called melanin (say: meh-luh-nin) that gives the growing shaft of hair its color of brown, blonde, red, and anything in between. . . Melanin is the same stuff that makes our skin's color fair or darker. It also helps determine whether a person will burn or tan in the sun. The dark or light color of someone's hair depends on how much melanin each hair contains.. . As we get older, the pigment cells in our hair follicles gradually die. When there are fewer pigment cells in a hair follicle, that strand of hair will no longer contain as much melanin and will become a more transparent color - like gray, silver, or white - as it grows. As people continue to get older, fewer pigment cells will be around to produce melanin. Eventually, the hair will look completely gray. . . People can get gray hair at any age. Some people go gray at a young age - as early as when they are in high school or college - whereas others may be in their 30s or 40s before they see that first gray hair. How early we get gray hair is determined by our genes. This means that most of us will start having gray hairs around the same age that our parents or grandparents first did. . . Gray hair is more noticeable in people with darker hair because it stands out, but people with naturally lighter hair are just as likely to go gray. From the time a person notices a few gray hairs, it may take more than 10 years for all of that person's hair to turn gray. . . Some people think that a big shock or trauma can turn a person's hair white or gray overnight, but scientists don't really believe that this happens. Just in case, try not to freak out your parents too much.

Beer skunks because of a reaction to light; beer in green bottles and clear bottles will skunk faster than beer in brown bottles. When beer fills a keg, it does not have enough time to skunk outside of the brewing keg. Ergo, it cannot skunk. But it could be a batch that's gone off because of age, or because it's been tapped and retapped incorrectly. If this is the case, then the place you got it is kind of sketchy. They shouldn't be selling \"used\" kegs. . . If you really think that you have a bad keg, don't drink it, 'cause, well, ew, but bring it back. If they give you a problem with it, don't let them; they can turn it back into the distributor for a full refund, so they shouldn't have a problem helping you out.

I do agree that often there will be some confusion to identfy the Koi and Gold fish. Though they belong to different genera. there are reports having cross bread individuals. It is very difficult to identify especially in the young age. One striking difference is almost all gold fish scales are very shiny and koi may be colourful but not so shiny. The second important feature is Koi will grow very fast but gold fish comparatively low. The caudal fin of Koi always will be simple but gold fish mostly it is fan like. When you are selecting very small fishes, this can be easily noticed.If you need only gold fish select those have fan type caudal fin. Koi colour patches are not soo unique and attractive like gold fish but except the variety calico most of the gold fishes have definite and attractive patterns.Koi is ideal only for garden pools but gold fish can be from small indoor tanks to garden pools. Koi's basic stucture is very similar to Common carp and doenot have a pot belly similar to gold fish, Koi is more or less spindle shape with longer body than caudal fin but gold fish especially if they are young, caudal fin length is equal to the body length except in one or two cases. Gold fish body width wlll come down immediately after the stomach and form tail. But koi posterior part slowly narrow down to have a caudal peduncle to form a simple tail.

{"ID":34789280,"ABSTRACT":"You can start by reading the article \"Starting a Janitorial and Cleaning Service Business\" at http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol95/janitorial.htm  The article contains information on startup strategies, operational considerations (prices, manpower, finding suppliers), and marketing the business. . . From the article, here are some tips:. . 1. The first step to marketing your business is deciding who your potential customers are and determining the types of services you could offer. . . 2. The best way to market this business is through cold calling. Drive through the area to look for newly opened businesses, buildings or facilities. Then introduce yourself to the landlords ?? your potential clients ?? and request for an opportunity to bid on their cleaning contract. For effective techniques on cold calling, read \"Tips to Successful Cold Calling\"  http://www.powerhomebiz.com/blog/2006/05/tips-to-successful-cold-calling.html. . 3. Draw up a better and more professional proposal by learning firsthand the needs of the potential customer, as well as the layout of the facility (e.g. type of carpeting, etc.). . 4. Networking is another effective strategy to get ahead in the janitorial business. Aside from newly opened buildings, get a list of companies that are downsizing or laying off cleaning staffs.. . 5. Word of mouth is another effective form of advertising a janitorial service. It can be generated through favorable feedback from your existing clients that will hopefully filter to other building owners or entrepreneurs in your area.. . 6. If you decide to embark on advertising, you can try placing an ad in newspapers or trade journals in your area. . . 7. You can also try direct mailing to potential customers, sending them information and brochures about your business.. . For detailed information I suggest you read the following books:. . - Janitorial Service Businesses : Strategies for Promoting, Estimating, and Bidding Cleaning Services . - The Janitorial Contractors Bible . - Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business . - Cleaning Up for a Living: Everything You Need to Know to Become a Successful Building Service Contractor . - Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business","NLTKTokens":["start","reading","article","starting","janitorial","cleaning","service","business","http","article","contains","information","startup","strategies","operational","considerations","prices","manpower","finding","suppliers","marketing","business","article","tips","first","step","marketing","business","deciding","potential","customers","determining","types","services","could","offer","best","way","market","business","cold","calling","drive","area","look","newly","opened","businesses","buildings","facilities","introduce","landlords","potential","clients","request","opportunity","bid","cleaning","contract","effective","techniques","cold","calling","read","tips","successful","cold","calling","http","draw","better","professional","proposal","learning","firsthand","needs","potential","customer","well","layout","facility","e.g","type","carpeting","etc","networking","another","effective","strategy","get","ahead","janitorial","business","aside","newly","opened","buildings","get","list","companies","downsizing","laying","cleaning","staffs","word","mouth","another","effective","form","advertising","janitorial","service","generated","favorable","feedback","existing","clients","hopefully","filter","building","owners","entrepreneurs","area","decide","embark","advertising","try","placing","newspapers","trade","journals","area","try","direct","mailing","potential","customers","sending","information","brochures","business","detailed","information","suggest","read","following","books","janitorial","service","businesses","strategies","promoting","estimating","bidding","cleaning","services","janitorial","contractors","bible","introduction","janitorial","service","contracting","succeed","cleaning","business","cleaning","living","everything","need","know","become","successful","building","service","contractor","introduction","janitorial","service","contracting","succeed","cleaning","business"]}

{"ID":218008611,"ABSTRACT":"References: Mormon vs Biblical Teachings about Salvation . . . Bible quotations are from the New American Standard version. For information on sources of Mormon quotations, see the section titled \"Mormon Documents\".. . . . 1. Mormons teach that salvation (exaltation) comes through faith in Christ plus baptism plus works, i.e., we must add to the work of Christ. In the Bible 'salvation' means deliverance from the consequence (eternal separation from God) of our sin. Mormon leaders have redefined the word 'salvation' to have a two-fold meaning: a) forgiveness of sins and b) universal resurrection:. . \"There will be a General Salvation for all in the sense in which that term is generally used, but salvation, meaning resurrection, is not exaltation\" (Stephen L. Richards, Contributions of Joseph Smith, LDS tract, p.5). . \"All men are saved by grace alone without any act on their part, meaning they are resurrected\" (Bruce McConkie, What Mormons Think of Christ\", LDS tract, p.28). . Thus, when a Mormon speaks of 'salvation by grace', he is usually referring to universal resurrection. Mormons use the term 'exaltation' to refer to attain a place in the highest level of heaven. The Mormon term 'exaltation' is more nearly equivalent to the Biblical term 'salvation'. What do Mormon leaders say about this?. . The Book of Mormon says of salvation: \"for we know that is is by grace that we are saved, after all that we can do\" (Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 25:23). . The LDS Third Article of Faith states: \"We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel\" (Pearl of Great Price: Articles of Faith). . Joseph Fielding Smith explains what that last phrase means: \"that which man merits through his own acts through life and by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel\" (Doctrines of Salvation, vol. 1, p.134). . James Talmage explains: \"...redemption from personal sins can only be obtained through obedience to the requirement of the Gospel, and a life of good works\" (James Talmage, in A Study of the Articles of Faith). . Spencer W. Kimball states: \"however powerful the saving grace of Christ, it brings exaltation to no man who does not comply with the works of the gospel\" (The Miracle of Forgiveness, pg. 207); \"Each command we obey sends us another rung up the ladder to perfected manhood and toward godhood; and every law disobeyed is a sliding toward the bottom where man merges into the brute world\" (Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, pg. 153); \"living all the commandments guarantees total forgiveness of sins and assures one of exaltation...trying is not sufficient. Nor is repentence when one merely tries to abandon sin\" (The Miracle of Forgiveness, p.164-165, 354-355). . Bruce McConkie claimed: \"Jesus kept the commandments of his Father and thereby worked out his own salvation, and also set an example as to the way and the means whereby all men may be saved\" (The Mortal Messiah, Vol.4, p.434). . What works do they mean? Here are some:. . Baptism for the dead: \"The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead...Those saints who neglect it in behalf of their deceased relatives, do it at peril of their own salvation\" (Joseph Smith, in Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p.356, 196). . Marriages sealed in the Temple: \"Marriage is not only a righteous institution, but obedience to this law [Temple marriage] is absolutely necessary in order to obtain the highest exaltation in the Kingdom of God\" (Milton R. Hunter, in Gospel Through the Ages, p.119). . Keeping the whole law: \"To enter the celestial [kingdom] and obtain exaltation, it is necessary that the whole law be kept...Do you desire to enter the celestial Kingdom and receive eternal life?

{"ID":40188913,"ABSTRACT":"A single word cannot be copyrighted.  It can be a trademark, but that's different.  If you are not using it as a trademark yourself, I can't see what the problem is.. . On all these \"infringement\" questions, common sense and your own experience must rule the day.  Haven't you seen words and phrases, names even, that are used in normal newspapers, magazine articles, and books?  People say things like \"I'll go get a Coke.\"  If it was illegal to use a trademarked name in that way, we'd never be able to say anything!  . . The basic rule in copyright is that if the ideas are, to your conscious mind, original to you, go ahead and use them.  If you purposely quote someone else, put it in quote marks and attribute it.  But if you just happen to choose the same words someone else in the past has used, that would not be an infringement.  However, if your entire chapter (or even a significant part of it) is word-for-word the same as someone else's, you're going to have trouble convincing a jury that you did not copy.. . Mama always said if you are honest, you don't have to worry about being sued.  That's something of an exaggeration in this modern litigious age, but it's about as good as we've got.

But, I got into a Bible study, where it was from beginning to end, and it was explained to me, and now I get it.. Unless a person is open to it w/ no judgement, and they are sincere in learning, not in disproving, God will open your spirit up to Him and HIs Word, and all will make sense.. Only those who seek it sincerely, and will find God, and only those who He reveals Himself to through His Word, will truly get it.. . Read 1 Cor 2:11-16:. \"For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us. This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words. The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned. The spiritual man makes judgments about all things, but he himself is not subject to any man's judgment: . \"For who has known the mind of the Lord .  that he may instruct him?\" But we have the mind of Christ.\". . I would reccomend if you really want to know answers and learn about Him either way, get yourself into a Bible study. . http://wec.upci.org/churches. . that will teach you the Word of God from beginning to end and you can make an educated decision on it for yourself....

{"ID":43727307,"ABSTRACT":"well let's say that the real thing is why don't you prove what you are saying is true which it's not It seems to me you have not researched the so called facts you state as you may have thought.   Parts of Noahs Ark have been sighted on Mount Ararat and bits of tarred gofer wood which the Ark was made from have been dated and found to be 5000 years old,this is proof that the bible is true, and there is more; Look at the Moabite Stone.The original can be seen in the Louvre Museum in Paris France. The writing tells of the rebellion of King Mesha of Moab against Israel. This  event is also reported in the Bible (2 Kings1:1:3:4-27) The Pool of Siloam and the entrance of a 1,749 foot  -long(533 meter-long)water tunnel in Jerusalem. Many modern-day visitors to Jerusalem have waded through this tunnel. It's existance is further proof that the Bible is true, The Bible explains that King Hezekiah had this tunnel built over2,500 years ago to protect his water supply from an invading army,-(2Kings20:20; 2Chronicles32:2-4,30)At the British Museum a visitor can see the Neabonidus Chronicle. It describes the fall of ancient Babylon, even as the Bible also does.(Daniel5:30,31)The Bible says that Belshazzar was then King of Babylon.  In fact, at one time all known writings said that Nabonidus was Babylon's last king. So some who said the Bible is not true claimed that Belshazzar never existed and that the Bible was wrong. But in recent years ancient writings have been found that identified Belshazzar as a son of Nabonidus and coruler with his father in Babylon at the time. Yes, the Bible really is true, as so many examples prove.Yet the Bible does not contain only true history.Everything it says is true, Even when it touches on matters of science, it is marvelously accurate.

{"ID":437273032,"ABSTRACT":"The Bible makes perfect sense if you understand the reason it was written.  It was not just one man sitting down and saying, I'm going to write this and everyone will believe me.  Every book in the Bible was written by a different person, and some were written by several people together.  Hense the names of the books.  e.g.the book of John, Peter, Galatians...They were named after the people that wrote them.  And since no one has exactly the same outlook on things as another person, all the details aren't exactly the same.  Let's say you and I were watching Jesus's crucifiction.  You're at the front of the crowd, throwing stones, and I'm at the back praying for Him to leave this world and join His Father.  From where you're standing, it looks one way.  But it's different where I'm at.  In the end, the simple fact is, He was still nailed to a cross and burned, along with two other men.  . . You also have to think about the language barrier.  You and I may speak English, and read our Bibles in English.  But the first Bibles were not written that way.  Every book in the Bible was written by a different person, from a different region of the world.  So, the Bible you know today has been translated and retranslated so many times, some of the words are not what they ere originally.  . . You can't expect the Bible to conform to how you think.  It was written thousands of years ago.  Things change over time.  But instead, try to put yourself in the mode of thinking that those people were in when they wrote it.  All they knew was what they saw, heard, felt, and experienced for them selves.  Than they wrote it down.  Just the same as celebrities and athletes do now.  You just have to look at it through a different pair of eyes for a little while.  Then you'll understand it.","NLTKTokens":["bible","makes","perfect","sense","understand","reason","written","sitting","saying","going","write","everyone","believe","every","book","bible","written","different","person","written","several","people","together","hense","names","books","e.g.the","book","john","galatians","named","people","wrote","since","exactly","outlook","things","another","person","details","n't","exactly","let","say","watching","jesus","crucifiction","front","crowd","throwing","stones","back","praying","leave","world","join","father","standing","looks","way","different","simple","fact","still","nailed","cross","burned","along","two","think","language","barrier","may","speak","english","read","bibles","english","first","bibles","written","way","every","book","bible","written","different","person","different","region","world","bible","know","today","translated","retranslated","many","times","words","ere","originally","n't","expect","bible","conform","think","written","thousands","years","ago","things","change","time","instead","try","put","mode","thinking","people","wrote","knew","saw","heard","felt","experienced","selves","wrote","celebrities","athletes","look","different","pair","eyes","little","understand"]}

{"ID":437273043,"ABSTRACT":"That is certainly more than one question.  To answer your first question: the Bible does make sense, and it is harmonious from cover to cover.  The problem arises when people try to force the Bible to fit their beliefs, instead of adjusting their beliefs to agree with Bible teachings.  For example, some want to say that the Bible says nothing about homosexuality because that fits their desires.  However, the Bible does indeed speak on the subject, and is consistent throughout.  When a person's beliefs go contrary to Bible teachings, what should he or she do?  Trust the Bible.. . Now, as to physical evidence...archaeologists have indeed found evidence as stated in the Bible.  In fact, there are things in the Bible that archaelogists and other scientists doubted...until they found it.  Whether it is the city of Ninevah, or certain kings stated in the Bible, to wells and other locales, the Bible has been found to be accurate.. . Your statement about evolution doesn't really hold water.  Even though bones and fossils have been found, even Darwin admitted that his theory has so many holes in it that it couldn't stand up to intense scrutiny.  The problem is that scientists refuse to apply scientific principles to their theory.  If a scientist finds data that contradicts a hypothesis, then by rights the scientist must discard the hypothesis and formulate a new one based on the new data.  However, with evolution, they refuse to discard it and instead try to force the data to fit the hypothesis.  In a way, evolution is their faith, rather than a science.. . Thus, instead of believing in \"religion\", trust in the Bible and speak with those who live their lives according to its principles, and those who are students of its teachings, rather than students of the philosophies of men.","NLTKTokens":["certainly","question","answer","first","question","bible","make","sense","harmonious","cover","cover","problem","arises","people","try","force","bible","fit","beliefs","instead","adjusting","beliefs","agree","bible","teachings","example","say","bible","says","nothing","homosexuality","fits","desires","however","bible","indeed","speak","subject","consistent","throughout","person","beliefs","go","contrary","bible","teachings","trust","bible","physical","evidence","archaeologists","indeed","found","evidence","stated","bible","fact","things","bible","archaelogists","scientists","doubted","found","whether","city","ninevah","certain","kings","stated","bible","wells","locales","bible","found","accurate","statement","evolution","n't","really","hold","water","even","though","bones","fossils","found","even","darwin","admitted","theory","many","holes","could","n't","stand","intense","scrutiny","problem","scientists","refuse","apply","scientific","principles","theory","scientist","finds","data","contradicts","hypothesis","rights","scientist","must","discard","hypothesis","formulate","new","based","new","data","however","evolution","refuse","discard","instead","try","force","data","fit","hypothesis","way","evolution","faith","rather","science","thus","instead","believing","religion","trust","bible","speak","live","lives","according","principles","students","teachings","rather","students","philosophies"]}

By 8:00 A.M. the nurses were begging the doctors to send him home (he was a rambunctious kid).  This is one of many and there is more to the story.  As far a the fossils record, did you know that the textbooks use a chart to show evolution in the dinosaurs but if you check the dates that the dinos existed they are out of order in the progression chart.

{"ID":264350713,"ABSTRACT":"Milk costs more, without sales, because of the cost involved in producing packaging, and transporting it. Cows need to be born and raised, given shots and medical care, fed and housed. They produce a limited amount of milk each day. Then the milk gets pasteurized and packaged in individual containers, and has to be transported in a way that keeps it cold the whole time. If it is on the shelf or in transit too long, you won't be able to drink it. Oil on the other hand is already in the ground and is pipelined to a place where it can be pumped into ships, trucks, or barrels. It doesn't need to stay cold and lasts forever. It can be transported without the expense of individual packages. Contrary to what many think today, there are still abundant supplies of it. As the supply decreases, the price will go up to above that of milk. In countries closer to the source, such as Kuwait, gas only costs about 82 cents per gallon, which is less than the cost of water there!","NLTKTokens":["milk","costs","without","sales","cost","involved","producing","packaging","transporting","cows","need","born","raised","given","shots","medical","fed","housed","produce","limited","amount","milk","day","milk","gets","pasteurized","packaged","individual","containers","transported","way","keeps","cold","whole","time","shelf","transit","long","n't","able","drink","oil","hand","already","ground","pipelined","place","pumped","ships","trucks","barrels","n't","need","stay","cold","lasts","forever","transported","without","expense","individual","packages","contrary","many","think","today","still","abundant","supplies","supply","decreases","price","go","milk","countries","closer","source","kuwait","gas","costs","cents","gallon","less","cost","water"]}

Launching the hysteria was the bizarre, seemingly inexplicable behavior of two young girls; the daughter, Betty, and the niece, Abigail Williams, of the Salem Village minister, Reverend Samuel Parris.  .      . The Witch House  In February, 1692, three accused women were examined by Magistrates Jonathan Corwin and John Hathorne. Corwin's home, known as the Witch House, still stands at the corner of North and Essex Streets in Salem, providing guided tours and tales of the first witchcraft trials. John Hathorne, an ancestor of author Nathaniel Hawthorne, is buried in the Charter Street Old Burying Point.   .    By the time the hysteria had spent itself, 24 people had died. Nineteen were hanged on Gallows Hill in Salem Town, but some died in prison. Giles Corey at first pleaded not guilty to charges of witchcraft, but subsequently refused to stand trial. This refusal meant he could not be convicted legally. However, his examiners chose to subject him to interrogation by the placing of stone weights on his body. He survived this brutal torture for two days before dying. . It is remarkable 552 original documents pertaining to the witchcraft trials have been preserved and are still stored by the Peabody Essex Museum. . . Eerie memorabilia associated with the trials, such as the \"Witch Pins\" used in the examination of witches and a small bottle supposed to contain the finger bones of the victim George Jacobs can be found there as well. .     .   *These short paragraphs are intended only as an introduction to a complex subject about which much has been written.  .

The world, redeemed from superstition's sway, .

From June through September of 1692, nineteen men and women, all having been convicted of witchcraft, were carted to Gallows Hill, a barren slope near Salem Village, for hanging. Another man of over eighty years was pressed to death under heavy stones for refusing to submit to a trial on witchcraft charges. Hundreds of others faced accusations of witchcraft. Dozens languished in jail for months without trials.  Then, almost as soon as it had begun, the hysteria that swept through Puritan Massachusetts ended. .     Why did this travesty of justice occur? Why did it occur in Salem? Nothing about this tragedy was inevitable. Only an unfortunate combination of an ongoing frontier war, economic conditions, congregational strife, teenage boredom, and personal jealousies can account for the spiraling accusations, trials, and executions that occurred in the spring and summer of 1692. . .

If you prefer a Holiday Festival, whatever, but if they are choosing to call it a Christmas Festival, then it should be about CHRISTMAS and not trying to make people of all religions happy.. . It's only a matter of time before Easter gets attacked too... well, you already see big pink bunnies all over the place... OK, never mind.  Easter has already lost its Christian meaning.  You never see signs that say Resurrection Sale Extravaganza, just as we're seeing far less signs that say Christmas Extravaganza.  Pretty soon, Easter is going to melt into the HOLIDAY pile of mush.. . When it does, I think the world will be much worse off.  Just as we are now, with Christmas becoming just another Holiday.","NLTKTokens":["taking","christ","christmas","like","taking","menorah","hanukkah","say","n't","called","christmas","trees","must","holiday","trees","instead","insulting","someone","calling","menorah","candle-holder","glad","see","still","called","christmas","rockefeller","center","last","night","happy","holidays","rockefeller","center","would","thrown","fit","think","christmas","festival","people","definitely","allowed","call","christian","really","business","christmas","festival","prefer","holiday","festival","whatever","choosing","call","christmas","festival","christmas","trying","make","people","religions","happy","matter","time","easter","gets","attacked","well","already","see","big","pink","bunnies","place","ok","never","mind","easter","already","lost","christian","meaning","never","see","signs","say","resurrection","extravaganza","seeing","far","less","signs","say","christmas","extravaganza","pretty","soon","easter","going","melt","holiday","pile","mush","think","world","much","worse","christmas","becoming","another","holiday"]}

{"ID":33960660,"ABSTRACT":"The air is much thinner at high altitudes, and the engines on long-range jets are designed to operate at their best efficency in thin air. Also, since the air is so much thinner at high altitude the resistance against the aircraft (drag) is much reduced, meaning they jet burns less fuel for the same effect. This translates into much better fuel economy, leaving more money per mile for the airline. Also, airliners cruise at different altitudes with a minimum 500' of separation. This makes for a lot of different \"lanes\" for them to use, and makes it safer for many planes to be in the air at the same time, reducing the chance of collision.","NLTKTokens":["air","much","thinner","high","altitudes","engines","long-range","jets","designed","operate","best","efficency","thin","air","since","air","much","thinner","high","altitude","resistance","aircraft","drag","much","reduced","meaning","jet","burns","less","fuel","effect","translates","much","better","fuel","economy","leaving","money","mile","airline","airliners","cruise","different","altitudes","minimum","separation","makes","lot","different","lanes","use","makes","safer","many","planes","air","time","reducing","chance","collision"]}

There's also a change over between your ground speed being limited by indicated air speed and mach number. Below that height, somewhere around 28,000 feet, as you climb at constant air speed your ground speed inscrease, above that height as you climb at constant mach number your ground speed decreases... and so does your indicated air speed which ultimately limits your altitude as your indicated air speed at maximum mach number starts to approach your minimum air speed without high lift devices.. . Passanger comfort and avoiding weather are important, but efficiency is king, that's why 747s were capable of M0.92 but more modern jets tend to cruise at M0.8 and max out at M0.875 or below.

If the disorder is decreased, then we can have a negative entropy change. Disorder decreases with a decrease in tempearture. But if we consider the whole universe, though there is a decrease in temperature at one particular point, there will be increase in temperature at other points. So, you will always see a positive change in entropy. According to third law of thermodynamics, change in entropy would be zero only at absolute temperature. And we can not attain absolute zero temperature as there would be temperature corresponding to zero point energy associated with the atoms. That is the reason why we can attain hundredth of a Kelvin but not absolute zero. In order for the change in entropy to be negative, you have to go below absolute zero which is not possible.

Absolute zero has very specific thermodynamic properties - it is the temperature where atoms have the minimum molecular vibration, which defines heat.  It's too complicated to describe here - suggest you check the reference.. . Anyway, looking at temperatures from absolute zero, all temperatures are positive.  Also, every element (and compound) has its own thermodynamic characteristics, including melting point, boiling point, and freezing point.  So Fluorine has a boiling point that is 85.15 degrees above absolute zero, water has a boiling point that is 373.15 degrees above absolute zero, and iron (for example) has a boiling point that is 3134 degrees above absolute zero.. .

Until 423 there was no \"bible\" or orthodoxy of belief....every little christian group, the Gnostics, Essenes and many others shared different views of who or what Jesus was, and used different versions of Gospels and letters.  . . Constantine ordered that the bishops make a catholic bible (ie broad in interest, appealing to the widest variety )  so they threw out the more contraversial and outrageous bits (and that's saying something !!!) edited and tried to correct inconsistencies with the included bits (and boy, did they miss a lot !!!!) came up with a canon, started persecuting heretic christians and building churches and forging relics with Constantines support.  Phew.. . As the Roman empire collapsed, what was now the Catholic church assumed a power vacuum in Rome and the pope became the de facto ruler of the former Roman Empire.  As literacy level dropped during the Dark Ages, and Latin fell out of common usage, the clergy were the only ones now with \"direct access\" to the word of god, and became incredibly powerful and rich as a result.

{"ID":229127210,"ABSTRACT":"Catholics trust in their good deeds to earn their way.. \"How should I witness to someone who belongs to a denomination, who I suspect isn???t trusting the Savior?\". . The most effective way to speak about the issues of eternity to a religious person is not to get sidetracked from the essentials of salvation. Upon hearing a person???s background, we may feel an obligation to speak to issues such as infant baptism, transubstantiation, etc. However, it is wise rather to build on the points of agreement between the Bible and the person???s denomination, such as the virgin birth, the cross, and so on. One point of agreement will almost certainly be the Ten Commandments. They are the key to bringing any religious person to a saving knowledge of the gospel. . . After someone is converted to Jesus Christ, the Bible will come alive and he will be led into all truth by the indwelling Holy Spirit. God???s Word will then give him light, and he will forsake religious tradition as he is led by God. While there are strong biblical arguments that may convince unregenerate people that their church???s traditions contradict Holy Scripture, there is a difficulty. Some religious people hold the teachings of their church to be on a par with, or of greater authority than, Holy Scripture. It is therefore often futile to try to convince them intellectually that their trust should be in the person of Jesus Christ, rather than in their own righteousness or in their church traditions.

In thermodynamics, there are four laws of very general validity, and as such they do not depend on the details of the interactions or the systems being studied.

Examples of this include Einstein's prediction of spontaneous emission around the turn of the 20th century and current research into the thermodynamics of black holes.. . The four laws are:. . Zeroth law of thermodynamics, stating that thermodynamic equilibrium is an equivalence relation. . If two thermodynamic systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. . . First law of thermodynamics, about the conservation of energy . The increase in the energy of a closed system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by heating, minus the amount lost in the form of work done by the system on its surroundings. . . Second law of thermodynamics, about entropy . The total entropy of any isolated thermodynamic system tends to increase over time, approaching a maximum value. . . Third law of thermodynamics, about absolute zero temperature .

{"ID":5904943,"ABSTRACT":"The yawn reflex is often described as contagious: if one person yawns, this will cause another person to \"sympathetically\" yawn.[3] The proximate cause for contagious yawning may lie with mirror neurons, i.e. neurons in the frontal cortex of certain vertebrates, which upon being exposed to a stimulus from conspecific (same species) and occasionally interspecific organisms, activates the same regions in the brain[4]. Mirror neurons have been proposed as a driving force for Imitation which lies at the root of much human learning, e.g. language acquisition. Yawning may be an offshoot of the same imitative impulse. At a distal level (in terms of evolutionary advantage), yawning might be a herd instinct.[5] Other theories suggest that the yawn serves to synchronize mood behavior among gregarious animals, similar to the howling of the wolf pack during a full moon. It signals tiredness to other members of the group in order to synchronize sleeping patterns and periods of activity. It can serve as a warning in displaying large, canine teeth. This phenomenon has been observed among various primates. The threat gesture is a way of maintaining order in the primates' social structure. The contagion of yawning is interspecific, for example a human yawning in front of a pet dog can incite the dog to yawn as well. Oddly, sometimes sympathetic yawning may be caused by simply looking at a picture of a person or animal yawning, or even seeing the word yawn.. .

Fortunately, most people with Anxiety Disorders can be helped to recover.. . There are several categories of Anxiety Disorders including:. . * Generalized Anxiety Disorder characterized by excessive, unrealistic worry that lasts over 6 months. Symptoms may include trembling, insomnia, dizziness and irritability;. * Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder characterized by persistent, recurring thoughts that exaggerate anxiety or fears;. * Panic Disorder characterized by severe distress that may make an individual feel like they are having a health problem or are losing control;. * Post Traumatic Stress Disorder can be followed by a traumatic event such as a sexual or physical assault, the unexpected death of a loved one, or a disaster. Symptoms may include sleep deprivation, irritability or poor concentration;. * Social Anxiety Disorder is characterized by extreme anxiety about being judged by others or behaving in a way that might cause embarrassment. Symptoms may include heart palpitations, faintness and blushing.. . How to Get Help for Anxiety Disorders:. . Effective treatments for Anxiety Disorders including medications and psycho-social treatment are available and if someone has symptoms, a visit to the family physician is usually the best place to start.

{"ID":25539653,"ABSTRACT":"Bloody Mary: The Unauthorized Biography. Controversy and intrigue are just two of the ingredients that go into this classic cocktail. Al Martinez spills the story..  .  . RELATED LINK:A Better Bloody.  To sip a Bloody Mary in New York's St. Regis Hotel is to be in the presence of a greater power. Not God, but Fernand \"Pete\" Petiot, who, it is said, invented what was to become America's favorite morning-after drink, the hangover remedy, the compelling and infamous hair of the dog. . . I sat in the very room, the King Cole Bar, where Pete and the Bloody were introduced to America in the 1930s. While not quite a cathedral, it is nonetheless a lounge of exquisite secular taste, enclosed in the comfort of dark wood and dominated by a large mural of the merry old soul himself, surrounded by an entourage from the lyrical world of the nursery rhyme.. . According to drinking lore, encapsulated in Christopher O'Hara's book The Bloody Mary (with William Nash photographs of such glory that you want to drink the pages), the Bloody was invented by bartender Petiot at Harry's New York Bar in Paris. The basic recipe consisted of vodka, tomato juice, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, salt, and cayenne pepper.. . Legend has it that he named it after Queen Mary Tudor, or Bloody Mary, the Catholic daughter of Henry VIII, who, during her five-year reign, managed to kill off an impressive number of Protestants. Even by the standards of 16th-century England, the slaughter of some 300 \"heretics\" seemed excessive.. . Others ascribe the name to a bar in Chicago called \"Bucket of Blood,\" and still others believe it was based on the complaints of a London visitor to Harry's Bar who kept drinking Petiot's tomato juice libation while going on about his wife, Mary. Using one of England's most popular adjectives, the man declared his wife was a bloody nag and bloody impossible, among other bloody evils. So Petiot, in a fit of whimsy, named his drink the Bloody Mary. You can believe any bloody story you like, but most seem to prefer the influence of the bloody Queen.. . However, for those who cant toward a good scare, there is the urban legend of a woman named Mary who was injured in an accident that tore her face so badly she bled to death. Her spirit is said to roam about, and if you stand before a mirror and say Bloody Mary three times, her mangled visage will appear. If so, dash for the door or she'll rip you up, too. You'll surely need a drink after that.. . To continue the more likely tale, John Jacob Astor fell in love with the Bloody at Harry's, and brought Petiot and his drink to The St. Regis, which the Astors owned. Word of its existence spread like a dirty joke, and in no time at all, the Bloody became a standard morning-after libation and, later, one of the drinks favored at a modern invention called brunch, leading it to become at one time the third most popular cocktail in the country. Fearful that the name might offend, however, the Astors renamed it the Red Snapper. But that, forgive me, lacked the snap of the original and ended up in the barrel of bad ideas, where the mango Martini and the Pet Rock reside.. . There are as many ways to prepare a Bloody Mary as there are to cook potatoes. King Cole bartender Gavin Fitzgibbon, himself somewhat of a cocktail historian, assured me that his Bloody was concocted with the same recipe created by Petiot. \"We do not,\" he proclaimed in the grand style of a purist, \"attempt to popularize it.\" Unlike those days in Paris, however, the drink at The St. Regis sells for $17, and while it is a very nice drink, it is not worth three times the price of the taxi that took me to the hotel in the first place.. .

{"ID":21737916,"ABSTRACT":"If you collected data about the heights of adults in your town, there would be a whole range of heights from less than 5 feet to over 6 feet. You could find the arithmetic mean (average) by adding up all the heights and dividing by the number of people. The standard deviation is a fancy way of working out what the average deviation from that mean is. It tells you a little bit more about a population that a simple mean does. For example, two towns might have the same mean height, but one town might be very multicultural and would have a large range of heights (large SD), whereas a very mono-cultural population would mostly fall within a small range (small SD).. . Here are two samples both with the same mean, but very different standard deviations:. . Sample A:  5, 8, 5, 3, 1, 4, 5, 5, 2, 3, 8, 5, 4, 6  (Mean = 4.57; SD = 1.98).

The Kelvin scale is a thermodynamic (absolute) temperature scale where absolute zero???the lowest possible temperature where nothing could be colder and no heat energy remains in a substance???is defined as zero kelvin (0 K). The unit increment of the Kelvin scale is the kelvin (symbol: K), which is the SI unit of temperature and is one of the seven SI base units. The unit ??kelvin??? and its scale by international agreement, defined by two points: absolute zero, and the triple point of specially prepared (VSMOW) water. This definition also precisely relates the Kelvin scale to the Celsius scale. Absolute zero???the temperature at which nothing could be colder and no heat energy remains in a substance???is defined as being precisely 0 K and ???273.15 ??C.

Knowledge is a broad category of all of the truths that a person can intellectually understand. I see wisdom as the smaller set of psychological or philosophical truths that one has gained, usually through experience. Wisdom is the knowledge of uncommon truth(s) that directly influences one's thoughts, feelings, and actions.. .

{"ID":7889765,"ABSTRACT":"That governments have permitted terrorist acts against their own people, and have even themselves been perpetrators in order to find strategic advantage is quite likely true, but this is the United States we're talking about.. . That intelligence agencies, financiers, terrorists and narco-criminals have a long history together is well established, but the Nugan Hand Bank, BCCI, Banco Ambrosiano, the P2 Lodge, the CIA/Mafia anti-Castro/Kennedy alliance, Iran/Contra and the rest were a long time ago, so there???s no need to rehash all that. That was then, this is now!. . That Jonathan Bush???s Riggs Bank has been found guilty of laundering terrorist funds and fined a US-record $25 million must embarrass his nephew George, but it's still no justification for leaping to paranoid conclusions.. . That George Bush's brother Marvin sat on the board of the Kuwaiti-owned company which provided electronic security to the World Trade Centre, Dulles Airport and United Airlines means nothing more than you must admit those Bush boys have done alright for themselves.. . That George Bush found success as a businessman only after the investment of Osama???s brother Salem and reputed al Qaeda financier Khalid bin Mahfouz is just one of those things - one of those crazy things.. . That Osama bin Laden is known to have been an asset of US foreign policy in no way implies he still is.. . That al Qaeda was active in the Balkan conflict, fighting on the same side as the US as recently as 1999, while the US protected its cells, is merely one of history's little aberrations.. . The claims of Michael Springman, State Department veteran of the Jeddah visa bureau, that the CIA ran the office and issued visas to al Qaeda members so they could receive training in the United States, sound like the sour grapes of someone who was fired for making such wild accusations.. . That one of George Bush's first acts as President, in January 2001, was to end the two-year deployment of attack submarines which were positioned within striking distance of al Qaeda's Afghanistan camps, even as the group's guilt for the Cole bombing was established, proves that a transition from one administration to the next is never an easy task.. . That so many influential figures in and close to the Bush White House had expressed, just a year before the attacks, the need for a \"new Pearl Harbor\" before their militarist ambitions could be fulfilled, demonstrates nothing more than the accidental virtue of being in the right place at the right time.. . That the company PTECH, founded by a Saudi financier placed on America???s Terrorist Watch List in October 2001, had access to the FAA???s entire computer system for two years before the 9/11 attack, means he must not have been such a threat after all.. . That whistleblower Indira Singh was told to keep her mouth shut and forget what she learned when she took her concerns about PTECH to her employers and federal authorities, suggests she lacked the big picture. And that the Chief Auditor for JP Morgan Chase told Singh repeatedly, as she answered questions about who supplied her with what information, that \"that person should be killed,\" suggests he should take an anger management seminar.. . That on May 8, 2001, Dick Cheney took upon himself the job of co-ordinating a response to domestic terror attacks even as he was crafting the administration???s energy policy which bore implications for America's military, circumventing the established infrastructure and ignoring the recommendations of the Hart-Rudman report, merely shows the VP to be someone who finds it hard to delegate.. . That the standing order which covered the shooting down of hijacked aircraft was altered on June 1, 2001, taking discretion away from field commanders and placing it solely in the hands of the Secretary of Defense, is simply poor planning and unfortunate timing.

{"ID":28315965,"ABSTRACT":"For other uses, see Yawn (disambiguation).. . . A dog yawning. A yawn (synonyms chasma, oscitation from the Latin verb oscitare, to open the mouth wide[1]) is a reflex of deep inhalation and exhalation associated with being tired, with a need to sleep, or from lack of stimulation. Pandiculation is the term for the act of stretching and yawning. Yawning is a powerful non-verbal message with several possible meanings, depending on the circumstances. It is also claimed to help increase the state of alertness of a person. The exact causes of yawning are still unknown.. . Contents.  [hide]. 1 Origin of the word. 2 Causes of yawning. 3 Contagiousness. 4 Trivia. 5 Superstitions. 6 Notes. 7 External links. [edit]Origin of the word. . The word \"yawn\" has evolved from the Middle English word yanen, an alteration of yonen, or yenen, which in turn comes from the Old English geonian.. [edit]Causes of yawning. . An indication of tiredness, stress, over-work, or boredom.. An action indicating psychological decompression after a state of high alert.. A means of expressing powerful emotions like anger, rejection, apathy or tedium.. Caused by low oxygen in the brain. A yawn can express strong anti-social messages, and so in some cultures people try to mute or mask them by placing a concealing hand over the yawning mouth.. . . A cat yawning. A previous long-standing hypothesis is that yawning is caused by an excess of carbon dioxide and lack of oxygen in the blood. The brain stem detects this and triggers the yawn reflex. The mouth stretches wide and the lungs inhale deeply, bringing oxygen into the lungs and hence to the bloodstream. It is almost certain, however, that this hypothesis is not correct. One study has documented that this effect does not exist.[2]. A more recent hypothesis is that yawning is used for regulation of body temperature. Another hypothesis is that yawns are caused by the same chemicals (neurotransmitters) in the brain that affect emotions, mood, appetite and other phenomena. These chemicals include serotonin, dopamine, glutamic acid and nitric oxide. As more of these compounds are activated in the brain, the frequency of yawning increases. Conversely, a greater presence in the brain of opiate neurotransmitters such as endorphins, reduces the frequency of yawning. Patients taking the serotonin reuptake inhibitor Paxil (Paroxetine HCl) have been observed yawning abnormally often. Another theory is that yawning is similar to stretching. Yawning, like stretching, increases blood pressure and heart rate while also flexing many muscles and joints. It is also theorized that yawning helps redistribute an oil-like substance which coats the lungs and aids breathing. Some have observed that if you try to stifle or prevent a yawn by clenching your jaws shut, the yawn is unsatisfying. As such, the stretching of jaw and face muscles seems to be necessary for a good yawn.. Some movements in psychotherapy such as Re-evaluation Counseling or co-counselling believe that yawning, along with laughter and crying are means of \"discharging\" painful emotion, and therefore can be encouraged in order to promote physical and emotional healing.. [edit]Contagiousness. . The yawn reflex is often described as contagious: if one person yawns, this will cause another person to \"sympathetically\" yawn.[3] The proximate cause for contagious yawning may lie with mirror neurons, i.e. neurons in the frontal cortex of certain vertebrates, which upon being exposed to a stimulus from conspecific (same species) and occasionally interspecific organisms, activates the same regions in the brain[4]. Mirror neurons have been proposed as a driving force for Imitation which lies at the root of much human learning, e.g. language acquisition. Yawning may be an offshoot of the same imitative impulse. At a distal level (in terms of evolutionary advantage), yawning might be a herd instinct.[5] Other theories suggest that the yawn serves to synch","NLTKTokens":["uses","see","yawn","disambiguation","yawning","yawn","synonyms","chasma","oscitation","latin","verb","oscitare","open","mouth","wide","reflex","deep","inhalation","exhalation","associated","tired","need","sleep","lack","stimulation","pandiculation","term","act","stretching","yawning","yawning","powerful","non-verbal","message","several","possible","meanings","depending","circumstances","claimed","help","increase","state","alertness","person","exact","causes","yawning","still","unknown","contents","hide","origin","word","causes","yawning","contagiousness","trivia","superstitions","notes","external","links","edit","origin","word","word","yawn","evolved","middle","english","word","yanen","alteration","yonen","yenen","turn","comes","old","english","geonian","edit","causes","yawning","indication","tiredness","stress","over-work","boredom","action","indicating","psychological","decompression","state","high","alert","means","expressing","powerful","emotions","like","anger","rejection","apathy","tedium","caused","low","oxygen","brain","yawn","express","strong","anti-social","messages","cultures","people","try","mute","mask","placing","concealing","hand","yawning","mouth","yawning","previous","long-standing","hypothesis","yawning","caused","excess","carbon","dioxide","lack","oxygen","blood","brain","stem","detects","triggers","yawn","reflex","mouth","stretches","wide","lungs","inhale","deeply","bringing","oxygen","lungs","hence","bloodstream","almost","certain","however","hypothesis","correct","study","documented","effect","exist","recent","hypothesis","yawning","used","regulation","body","temperature","another","hypothesis","yawns","caused","chemicals","neurotransmitters","brain","affect","emotions","mood","appetite","phenomena","chemicals","include","serotonin","dopamine","glutamic","acid","nitric","oxide","compounds","activated","brain","frequency","yawning","increases","conversely","greater","presence","brain","opiate","neurotransmitters","endorphins","reduces","frequency","yawning","patients","taking","serotonin","reuptake","inhibitor","paxil","paroxetine","hcl","observed","yawning","abnormally","often","another","theory","yawning","similar","stretching","yawning","like","stretching","increases","blood","pressure","heart","rate","flexing","many","muscles","joints","theorized","yawning","helps","redistribute","oil-like","substance","coats","lungs","aids","breathing","observed","try","stifle","prevent","yawn","clenching","jaws","shut","yawn","unsatisfying","stretching","jaw","muscles","seems","necessary","good","yawn","movements","psychotherapy","re-evaluation","counseling","co-counselling","believe","yawning","along","laughter","crying","means","discharging","painful","emotion","therefore","encouraged","order","promote","physical","emotional","healing","edit","contagiousness","yawn","reflex","often","described","contagious","person","yawns","cause","another","person","sympathetically","yawn","proximate","cause","contagious","yawning","may","lie","mirror","neurons","i.e","neurons","frontal","cortex","certain","vertebrates","upon","exposed","stimulus","conspecific","species","occasionally","interspecific","organisms","activates","regions","brain","mirror","neurons","proposed","driving","force","imitation","lies","root","much","human","learning","e.g","language","acquisition","yawning","may","offshoot","imitative","impulse","distal","level","terms","evolutionary","advantage","yawning","might","herd","instinct","theories","suggest","yawn","serves","synch"]}

The legislation is put in place by people that fear the breed...and has had unfortunate accidents happen to them or friends.  They believe it is sole the dog's responsibility on how it acted.  They believe certain \"types\" of dog inherently are aggressive, and therefore are menace to society.  They believe that they are qualified in making the decision on what breed is worthy to live or not.  They believe that owners of said dogs have no responsibility towards the dog that cause the accident and should be allowed to carry on with life as it was before.  Meanwhile the dog gets destroyed.  The media then plays into those beliefs to get more support to push the issue.. .

However, when a pit bull bites, it is more likely to be fatal. . A lot of this legislation has been based on statistical data from the CDC that breaks down dog bite related fatalities according to the breed of dog. Right now rottweilers and pit bulls are at the top of the list. Statisitics that break up dog bite related fatalities are inaccurate in a lot of ways. They do no account for the percentage of the dog population - popular breeds will obviously show up more than rare ones. Also, they do not take into account the role the owner plays. Because of their reputations, pit bulls are often selected by people who want a mean dog. You can make a golden retriever mean if you want to, but you wouldn't get one if you wanted to.

{"ID":36689590,"ABSTRACT":"Rape is about power not sex. This is the first misconception about rape. It is about dominance and control. Men rape women, and other men, and children. Women can rape, but statistics are not very high. Rape does not have to be anal or vaginal penetration, it can be oral and any behaviour in which the survivor of the rape did not consent to. This means that rape can and does happen in marriage. Women are more likely to be raped by people they know, as opposed to strangers.. Rape is about power, not sex. A rapist uses actual force or violence - or the threat of it - to take control over another human being. Some rapists use drugs to take away a person's ability to fight back. Rape is a crime, whether the person committing it is a stranger, a date, an acquaintance, or a family member.. . No matter how it happened, rape is frightening and traumatizing. People who have been raped need care, comfort, and a way to heal.. . Why Does it Happen?. . Let's look at sexual stereotyping and how males and females talk to each other. . . Although things are changing, society still frequently encourages men to be competitive and aggressive and teaches women to be passive and avoid confrontation. . Men say they misunderstand a woman's words and actions ??? the excuse \"she said no, but meant yes.\" . Some people ??? men and women alike ??? still believe that it's okay for a man to demand sex if he takes a woman out or buys her gifts, and that it's not rape if he forces sex on a woman who previously had sex with him or other men. . Women also feel that if they've previously had sex with their boyfriend and he later forces her to have sex against her will, it may not be considered rape. . . Date rape can happen in homosexual relationships as well as heterosexual ones. Although it is less frequent, men can also be the victim of rape. It is still a crime and the victim still needs to get medical attention and counseling as soon as possible.. . Rape is the sexual expression of. hostility and aggression - a behavioral act not a psychiatric. condition. Rape typically reflects deep seated feelings of. inadequacy. . . Men rape because they believe they have the right to control and to punish women who do not obey their rules of behaviour. Rape is an expression of unequal power relations between men and women. Such unequal power relations are not the result of nature or evolution but societies which, through legislation and social custom, have made women second-class citizens.. . .  In our culture sex is so interfused with violence that powerlessness and power themselves have become eroticized. Getting at the real motives of rapists is difficult since they typically do not admit their crimes. Experts say rapists are notoriously manipulative and don't always tell the truth.","NLTKTokens":["rape","power","sex","first","misconception","rape","dominance","control","rape","women","children","women","rape","statistics","high","rape","anal","vaginal","penetration","oral","behaviour","survivor","rape","consent","means","rape","happen","marriage","women","likely","raped","people","know","opposed","strangers","rape","power","sex","rapist","uses","actual","force","violence","threat","control","another","human","rapists","use","drugs","away","person","ability","fight","back","rape","crime","whether","person","committing","stranger","date","acquaintance","family","member","matter","happened","rape","frightening","traumatizing","people","raped","need","comfort","way","heal","happen","let","look","sexual","stereotyping","males","females","talk","although","things","changing","society","still","frequently","encourages","competitive","aggressive","teaches","women","passive","avoid","confrontation","say","misunderstand","woman","words","actions","excuse","said","meant","yes","people","women","alike","still","believe","okay","demand","sex","takes","woman","buys","gifts","rape","forces","sex","woman","previously","sex","women","feel","previously","sex","boyfriend","later","forces","sex","may","considered","rape","date","rape","happen","homosexual","relationships","well","heterosexual","ones","although","less","frequent","victim","rape","still","crime","victim","still","needs","get","medical","attention","counseling","soon","possible","rape","sexual","expression","hostility","aggression","behavioral","act","psychiatric","condition","rape","typically","reflects","deep","seated","feelings","inadequacy","rape","believe","right","control","punish","women","obey","rules","behaviour","rape","expression","unequal","power","relations","women","unequal","power","relations","result","nature","evolution","societies","legislation","social","custom","made","women","second-class","citizens","culture","sex","interfused","violence","powerlessness","power","become","eroticized","getting","real","motives","rapists","difficult","since","typically","admit","crimes","experts","say","rapists","notoriously","manipulative","n't","always","tell","truth"]}

{"ID":34068650,"ABSTRACT":"If your partner says 'WAS THAT IT???' then that's premature ejaculation!","NLTKTokens":["partner","says","premature","ejaculation"]}
{"ID":34068651,"ABSTRACT":"Premature ejaculation occurs when you ejaculate too quickly and without control. It occurs before or shortly after penetration. Premature ejaculation interferes with the sexual pleasure of both you and your partner. It causes feelings of guilt,embarrassment, frustration, and depression. Premature ejaculation will cause stress in even the healthiest relationship.. . The Cause of Severe Premature Ejaculation.. . 1. Extreme levels of arousal caused by the overproduction of sex hormones. Simply stated - Hormones control \"everything\" that happens during a sexual performance - from the erection to the ejaculation!. . A normal ejaculation occurs when sexual excitement triggers glands, located inside your body, to begin a slow release of chemicals (hormones) into your blood stream. The slow release of these hormones tells your brain to gently stimulate the nerves at the glans (head of your penis). As you become more and more sexually excited, your body produces more and more of these hormones. The sensitivity becomes greater and greater until you reach the point at which time you ejaculate. Under normal circumstances the production of hormone is gradual and a man has the ability to control the sensations of sex.. . Premature Ejaculation occurs when your body produces too much hormone too fast. Your body becomes \"over stimulated\". The head of the penis becomes so sensitive that you ejaculate almost immediately. There is absolutely no control.. . This Extreme Sensitivity on the head of your penis causes the ejaculatory mechanism, inside your body, to go into \"spasms\". It's these spasms that cause the overpowering Urge to Ejaculate. The head of your penis becomes so sensitive and the urge is so strong that you ejaculate immediately.. If you slow down the production of excess hormone - you slow down the ejaculation.. . In fact, there's NO product, exercise, or technique that can stop severe premature ejaculation when used alone. NONE! Severe premature ejaculation is an extremely complex condition the causes of premature ejaculation are both physical and psychological. To cure premature ejaculation requires a combination of products that simultaneously attack and eliminate each cause. Only Last-Longer has a combination of products strong enough to eliminate ALL aspects of both the physical and psychological causes of premature ejaculation.. Quite often, when a man gains good ejaculatory control, he suddenly becomes much more interested in sex. And even if he doesn't, it might be nicer for both of you if he lasted longer.. . Faced with involuntary ejaculation, most men try to distract themselves during intercourse, believing that by thinking about other things, they can trick themselves into lasting longer. Usually, that only makes things worse.. . Don't tune out your body. TUNE INTO IT. You need to become more familiar with your different levels of sexual arousal. You also need to recognize how you feel as you approach your point of ejaculatory inevitability, the \"point of no return.\" Once you recognize how you feel close to your point of no return, it's not difficult to make small sexual adjustments that allow you to remain highly aroused without ejaculating.. . Sexual arousal is a four-phase process. In the Excitement Phase, breathing deepens and erection begins. In the Plateau Stage, erection becomes full and you feel highly aroused. When arousal builds to a certain point, the next phase occurs, Orgasm with Ejaculation. Then during the Resolution Phase, breathing returns to normal and erection subsides. The key to ejaculatory control is to extend the Plateau Phase, to maintain arousal without triggering Orgasm and Ejaculation.. .

Therefore they developed a system of people voting in order say who they wanted to represent their best intrests.

That is why they developed the electoral college, so that even if a candiate won the popular vote, they would not necessarily become president.

{"ID":38602320,"ABSTRACT":"Standard Deviation, a number representing how closely bunched a set of numbers is around its mean, or average value. The standard deviation is an important concept in statistics because it is a precise indicator of the degree of variability within a set of numbers. A set with a smaller standard deviation consists of more closely bunched numbers than a set with a larger standard deviation. If the test scores of a class were 76, 80, 82, 85, and 91, for example, the standard deviation would be about 5.04, reflecting the fact that the scores are fairly close together. A class with the wildly varying test scores 0, 53, 77, 91, and 100, however, would have a standard deviation of about 35.8.. . The standard deviation of a set of numbers is calculated using the deviation of individual numbers from the set???s mean. Each deviation is found by subtracting the number from the mean. If there are n members in a set and the deviations of the members from the mean are symbolized by x1 through xn, the standard deviation (??) is given by the formula: .  . . . To compute the standard deviation of the set {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}, for example, first find the mean. The mean is the sum of all the members of a set divided by the number of members of the set: (2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 9)/5 = 25/5 = 5. The individual deviations from the mean are 5 ??? 2 = 3, 5 ??? 3 = 2, 5 ??? 5 = 0, 5 ??? 6 = -1, and 5 - 9 = -4. Square the individual deviations and add them together: 32 + 22 + 02 + (-1)2 + (-4)2 = 9 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 16 = 30. Divide the result by the number of members of the set: 30/5 = 6. Take the square root and round to two decimal places: ???6 = 2.45. The standard deviation of {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}, therefore, is 2.45.. . This equation works for sets in which all members are specified. A more complex equation is necessary to determine the standard deviation of a set using only a sample of that set???s elements.. . OR:. Standard deviation is a statistical measure of dispersion: a statistical measure of the amount by which a set of values differs from the arithmetical mean, equal to the square root of the mean of the differences' squares","NLTKTokens":["standard","deviation","number","representing","closely","bunched","set","numbers","around","mean","average","value","standard","deviation","important","concept","statistics","precise","indicator","degree","variability","within","set","numbers","set","smaller","standard","deviation","consists","closely","bunched","numbers","set","larger","standard","deviation","test","scores","class","example","standard","deviation","would","reflecting","fact","scores","fairly","close","together","class","wildly","varying","test","scores","however","would","standard","deviation","standard","deviation","set","numbers","calculated","using","deviation","individual","numbers","set","mean","deviation","found","subtracting","number","mean","members","set","deviations","members","mean","symbolized","xn","standard","deviation","given","formula","compute","standard","deviation","set","example","first","find","mean","mean","sum","members","set","divided","number","members","set","individual","deviations","mean","square","individual","deviations","add","together","divide","result","number","members","set","square","root","round","two","decimal","places","standard","deviation","therefore","equation","works","sets","members","specified","complex","equation","necessary","determine","standard","deviation","set","using","sample","set","elements","standard","deviation","statistical","measure","dispersion","statistical","measure","amount","set","values","differs","arithmetical","mean","equal","square","root","mean","differences","squares"]}

{"ID":8457110,"ABSTRACT":"Anxiety is nothing more than a feeling of apprehension and uncertainty. Believe it or not some anxiety is normal and healthy. Chronic, and continuous worry, however, is not. Everyone experiences some anxiety even on a daily basis but people with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) experience constant anxiety which often has no apparent cause. GAD may be mild and manageable, but, for some people, it is debilitating. It can also cause and/or aggravate additional health problems, both physical and psychological.. . People with GAD often worry about the same problems everyone worries about - money, health, families, jobs, etc. The problem is, people with GAD worry excessively and constantly. People without GAD have the ability to put normal worries on hold and focus on daily activity. People with GAD are often distracted by their worries and find it difficult to think about anything else.. . Many people with GAD also feel constant anxiety with no apparent cause. They wake up feeling anxious and can never pinpoint a direct cause. The anxiety never seems to disappear throughout the day.. . \"Unfortunately, most people with GAD assume that they are just a 'nervous person' and that nothing can be done. They do not usually seek treatment unless their anxiety is complicated by depression, panic attacks or alcoholism. With appropriate treatment, however, GAD sufferers can feel less anxious and function better.\" -- Deborah Cowley, MD, in Psychopharmacology. . The cause of GAD has yet to be determined, and there is probably more than one possible cause. GAD appears to run in families, so there is probably a genetic factor. A major traumatic or stressful event may sometimes trigger GAD. Another theory is that the person with GAD has internal conflicts which have yet to be resolved. GAD may begin in childhood or later in life. Most likely, GAD has both physiological and psychological components.. . Generalized anxiety disorder is a relatively common anxiety problem, affecting 3-4% of the population, that turns daily life into a state of worry, anxiety, and fear. Excessive thinking and dwelling on the \"what ifs\" characterizes this anxiety disorder. As a result, the person feels there???s no way out of the vicious cycle of anxiety and worry, and then becomes depressed about life and the state of anxiety they find themselves in.. . Generalized anxiety usually does not cause people to avoid situations, and there isn???t an element of a \"panic attack\" involved in the prognosis, either. It???s the thinking, thinking, thinking, dwelling, dwelling, ruminating, ruminating, and inability to shut the mind off that so incapacitates the person. At other times, thoughts seem almost non-existent because the anxious feelings are so dominant. Feelings of worry, dread, lack of energy, and a loss of interest in life are common. Many times there is no \"trigger\" or \"cause\" for these feelings and the person realizes these feelings are irrational. Nevertheless, the feelings are very real. At this point, there is no \"energy\" or \"zest\" in life and no desire to want to do much.. . This emotional fear and worry can be quite strong. If a loved one is ten minutes late, the person with generalized anxiety fears the very worst -- something???s dreadfully wrong (after all, they???re ten minutes late!), there???s been an accident, the paramedics are taking the person to the hospital and his injuries are just too critical to resuscitate him.....\"Oh, my God!.....WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?\" Feelings of fear and anxiety rush in from these thoughts, and the vicious cycle of anxiety and depression runs wild.. . Some people with generalized anxiety have fluctuations in mood from hour to hour, whereas others have \"good days\" and \"bad days\". Others do better in the morning, and others find it easier at the end of the day. These anxiety feelings and moods feed on themselves, leading ","NLTKTokens":["anxiety","nothing","feeling","apprehension","uncertainty","believe","anxiety","normal","healthy","chronic","continuous","worry","however","everyone","experiences","anxiety","even","daily","basis","people","generalized","anxiety","disorder","gad","experience","constant","anxiety","often","apparent","cause","gad","may","mild","manageable","people","debilitating","cause","and/or","aggravate","additional","health","problems","physical","psychological","people","gad","often","worry","problems","everyone","worries","money","health","families","jobs","etc","problem","people","gad","worry","excessively","constantly","people","without","gad","ability","put","normal","worries","hold","focus","daily","activity","people","gad","often","distracted","worries","find","difficult","think","anything","else","many","people","gad","feel","constant","anxiety","apparent","cause","wake","feeling","anxious","never","pinpoint","direct","cause","anxiety","never","seems","disappear","throughout","day","unfortunately","people","gad","assume","nervous","person","nothing","done","usually","seek","treatment","unless","anxiety","complicated","depression","panic","attacks","alcoholism","appropriate","treatment","however","gad","sufferers","feel","less","anxious","function","better","deborah","cowley","md","psychopharmacology","cause","gad","yet","determined","probably","possible","cause","gad","appears","run","families","probably","genetic","factor","major","traumatic","stressful","event","may","sometimes","trigger","gad","another","theory","person","gad","internal","conflicts","yet","resolved","gad","may","begin","childhood","later","life","likely","gad","physiological","psychological","components","generalized","anxiety","disorder","relatively","common","anxiety","problem","affecting","population","turns","daily","life","state","worry","anxiety","fear","excessive","thinking","dwelling","ifs","characterizes","anxiety","disorder","result","person","feels","way","vicious","cycle","anxiety","worry","becomes","depressed","life","state","anxiety","find","generalized","anxiety","usually","cause","people","avoid","situations","element","panic","attack","involved","prognosis","either","thinking","thinking","thinking","dwelling","dwelling","ruminating","ruminating","inability","shut","mind","incapacitates","person","times","thoughts","seem","almost","non-existent","anxious","feelings","dominant","feelings","worry","dread","lack","energy","loss","interest","life","common","many","times","trigger","cause","feelings","person","realizes","feelings","irrational","nevertheless","feelings","real","point","energy","zest","life","desire","much","emotional","fear","worry","quite","strong","loved","ten","minutes","late","person","generalized","anxiety","fears","worst","something","dreadfully","wrong","ten","minutes","late","accident","paramedics","taking","person","hospital","injuries","critical","resuscitate","oh","god","going","feelings","fear","anxiety","rush","thoughts","vicious","cycle","anxiety","depression","runs","wild","people","generalized","anxiety","fluctuations","mood","hour","hour","whereas","others","good","days","bad","days","others","better","morning","others","find","easier","day","anxiety","feelings","moods","feed","leading"]}

Some were more \"deistic\" (God exists but is detached from humanity and not entirely personal) in nature, but these are only two major contributions of believers in the faith(s) you're putting down. . . That being said, religion has been abused for centuries, as long as man has had it. Any belief system can be abused, especially one that believes that some things are right and other things are wrong. (And the only systems that can't cause damage are those that have no absolute values to exploit -- so they don't do much anyway.). . And there's a lot of garbage going on in our culture right now, regarding religious people who use religion as a means to  control others rather than serve them.

Islamic Extremists are threatening to overthrow the government there. . . This is a new type of war. A war that can't be fought by guns and bombs and invasions. This is a war about peoples well being. Why have the Taliban made such strong strides in Afghanistan? Because they're bringing stability to the region. They bring the rule of law. . . If you look at the statistics for the places where extremism is on the rise, you can see that those places are very insular and have high rates of unemployment.

For example, if a smell is to be recognized and to be kept in memory, nerve impulses from the olfactory tract would travel to the limbic system of the brain; this system is made up of the hippocampus, thalamus, and the amygdala which control a person's memory. When the brain receives an impulse of something that is reoccuring over and over again, it will store it as a memory so it will be remembered.

The subgenus is distinguished from other subgenera (peaches, cherries, bird cherries, etc) in the shoots having a terminal bud and the side buds solitary (not clustered), the flowers being grouped 1-5 together on short stems, and the fruit having a groove running down one side, and a smooth stone.. . Any of more than 125 varieties of fruit, most grown for drying. Four of the most common varities are French, Imperial, Italian, and Green Gage. Prunes are cultivars of plum species (mostly Prunus domestica). In general, prunes are freestone cultivars (the stone is easy to remove), whereas plums are cling (the stone is more difficult to remove).

These catch the mice inside a box-like structure so you can release them elsewhere, preferably somewhere far from any houses. People usually have mixed results with these. You could also just get regular spring mouse traps. They usually kill the animal instantly, by breaking their spinal cord. Just be sure to check them often.. You also need to understand how the other methods work in order to pick the right one. Rat poison doesn't cause dehydration, but instead it causes internal bleeding, until the animal eventually dies. MAKE SURE TO KEEP THIS AWAY FROM PETS OR LIVESTOCK-- THEY WILL AFFECT THEM THE SAME WAY. and treatment is expensive.  Glue traps work by trapping the animal and waiting for them to starve to death or dehydrate. Can also be harmful for pets.

{"ID":34797952,"ABSTRACT":"(from Ferdinand Petiot) . The most commonly accepted theory is that the Bloody Mary was born at Harry's American Bar in Paris in the 1920s, spurred by the arrival of the first tins of tomato juice from the United States, according to Dale DeGroff in \"The Craft of the Cocktail\" (Clarkson Potter, $35, 230 pages). Vodka was relatively new in Paris at the time, thanks to Russian emigres fleeing the Bolshevik revolution, and bartenders were mixing it with just about anything. . . The man credited with the drink's invention is Harry's bartender Ferdinand Petiot. When Petiot crossed the Atlantic in the 1930s to run the King Cole Bar in the St. Regis Hotel in New York City, he made a few changes to his creation. He used gin, according to DeGroff, because vodka was not yet available in the United States. And he renamed the drink the Red Snapper because the term \"Bloody Mary\" wasn't deemed acceptable at the time. When the drink flipped back to vodka, it resumed its original name. . . That name may have blue-blooded roots (the English Tudor queen) or a more blue-collar origin (a Harry's regular named Mary). Another theory appeared in The Chronicle's 1975 obituary for Petiot: An American entertainer who sampled the cocktail at Harry's said it reminded him of a Chicago club called the Bucket of Blood. . . Over time, the basic recipe has evolved to include vodka, tomato juice, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, lime or lemon juice, celery salt and black pepper, with Tabasco sauce optional. Just as coffee can run the gamut from black to caramel-mocha-frappa-whappa, the Bloody Mary is prone to variation. These include the Bloody Caesar (made with clam juice), Bloody Maria (tequila), Bloody Bull (beef bouillon), and others made with beer and sake.","NLTKTokens":["ferdinand","petiot","commonly","accepted","theory","bloody","mary","born","harry","american","bar","paris","spurred","arrival","first","tins","tomato","juice","united","states","according","dale","degroff","craft","cocktail","clarkson","potter","pages","vodka","relatively","new","paris","time","thanks","russian","emigres","fleeing","bolshevik","revolution","bartenders","mixing","anything","credited","drink","invention","harry","bartender","ferdinand","petiot","petiot","crossed","atlantic","run","king","cole","bar","st","regis","new","york","city","made","changes","creation","used","gin","according","degroff","vodka","yet","available","united","states","renamed","drink","red","snapper","term","bloody","mary","n't","deemed","acceptable","time","drink","flipped","back","vodka","resumed","original","may","blue-blooded","roots","english","tudor","queen","blue-collar","origin","harry","regular","named","mary","another","theory","appeared","chronicle","obituary","petiot","american","entertainer","sampled","cocktail","harry","said","reminded","chicago","club","called","bucket","blood","time","basic","recipe","evolved","include","vodka","tomato","juice","horseradish","worcestershire","sauce","lime","lemon","juice","celery","salt","black","pepper","tabasco","sauce","optional","coffee","run","gamut","black","caramel-mocha-frappa-whappa","bloody","mary","prone","variation","include","bloody","caesar","made","clam","juice","bloody","maria","tequila","bloody","bull","beef","bouillon","others","made","beer","sake"]}

Petiot says: \"One of the boys suggested we call the drink 'Bloody Mary' because it reminded him of the Bucket of Blood Club in Chicago, and a girl there named Mary.\". . 1927: This is the year that George Jessel claims to have invented the Bloody Mary in his Palm Beach home. He claims the name happened when his friend Mary spilled some of the concoction on her shirt and she said, \"Now, you can call me Bloody Mary, George!\". . 1934: Petiot moves to the King Cole Bar at the St. Regis in New York. His drink becomes popular with New Yorkers but something is missing. The hotel asks him to change the name to the Red Snapper, but it doesn't catch on and it is again called the Bloody Mary. His patrons encourage him to make the drink spicy, so he adds cayenne pepper, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, lemon, and a big dash of Tabasco?? sauce. The recipe is a hit.. . March 30, 1956: George Jessel takes out an ad in Collier's that reads: ??I think I invented The Bloody Mary, Red Snapper, Tomato Pickup or Morning Glory. It happened on a Night before a Day and I felt I should take some good, nourishing tomato juice, but what I really wanted was some of your good Smirnoff Vodka. So I mixed them together, the juice for body and the vodka for spirit, and if I wasn't the first ever, I was the happiest ever.???. . Aug. 15, 1956: The Bloody Mary is mentioned in Punch magazine: \"Those two ... are eating raw steaks and drinking Bloody Marys.???. . July 18, 1964: Petiot tells the New Yorker: \"I initiated the Bloody Mary of today. George Jessel said he created it, but it was really nothing but vodka and tomato juice when I took it over. I cover the bottom of the shaker with four large dashes of salt, two dashes of black pepper, two dashes of cayenne pepper, and a layer of Worcestershire sauce; I then add a dash of lemon juice and some cracked ice, put in two ounces of vodka and two ounces of thick tomato juice, shake, strain, and pour. We serve a hundred to a hundred and fifty Bloody Marys a day here in the King Cole Room and in the other restaurants and the banquet rooms.\". .

The reality is that most women who have period problems usually have one of two issues.  1.) low body fat  or 2.) low fat consumption.  Hormones are made by fats ingested in the body.  If the wrong type or amount of fats are being ingested, then the body has a hard time regulating the hormones produced.  In addition often times severe stress will cause this as the hormone precursors are pushed into what is known as the adrenal cascade - this is where the body uses the hormone precursors usually used for estrogen and progesterone and begins using them to assist with stress managment hormones.  . . A simple adrenal stess profile - a urinalysis any doctor can order, but usually not done by any one other than a doc practicing functinal medicine - will let you know how your hormones are working.  . . Regardless - if it is a fat intake problem - I would recommend supplementing the diet with some fish oil (if not preg.) or with flax seed oil.  Both are wonderful for a host of conditions and support normal hormone production.. . As always, a non-expensive, simple blood test by any doc can rule out the more serious issues - and they should be ruled out.. .

There exists a unique connection between art and civil society in our American democracy.

Since the late nineteenth century, American music has evolved as an expression of the social climate and environment of the times. Throughout its modern history, this expression has diverged into various styles attracting its disciples of music taste. Some expressions, like traditional jazz, Dixieland, big band swing, disco, and others stagnated, refusing to evolve, becoming footnotes and addendums of this rich history. Today, the adherents of this music reveal its beauties with anachronistic fervor. Some expressions, like jazz, the Blues, Latin, and others, continue to evolve into refined stages and altered states. Its music re-emerging with each generation in creative and unique combinations. But nowhere, to this point, has the message been more important than the medium that sends it. To this end, rap music has emerged with a style more concerned with the content of its message than the constructs of its art form. . .

Any legal actions the parents might pursue would be a civil suit.. . Also, in most cases, the court will appoint a lawyer to represent the child's interests, seperate from the parents, even if the parent(s) are not the offender.  (Again, how well they preform their jobs can be an issue...). . So, it's not a matter of it being legal or not, and who will pursue it, but it's more a matter of whether or not the legal system will adequately punish the offender, but all too often, they get away with just a slap on the wrist, because, after all, children don't vote or pay taxes, so they aren't as important to elected officials as they should be.","NLTKTokens":["legal","way","someone","molest","child","matter","whether","punishment","fits","crime","another","matter","opinion","however","regardless","child","age","charges","n't","pressed","parents","pressed","state","parents","n't","say","matter","except","parent","comes","forward","saying","child","molested","even","state","press","charges","matter","cooperative","parents","going","legal","actions","parents","might","pursue","would","civil","suit","cases","court","appoint","lawyer","represent","child","interests","seperate","parents","even","parent","offender","well","preform","jobs","issue","matter","legal","pursue","matter","whether","legal","system","adequately","punish","offender","often","get","away","slap","wrist","children","n't","vote","pay","taxes","n't","important","elected","officials"]}

{"ID":27833981,"ABSTRACT":"The nucleus serves as the cell???s command center, sending directions to the cell to grow, mature, divide, or die. It also houses DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the cell???s hereditary material. The nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear envelope, which protects the DNA and separates the nucleus from the rest of the cell. The nucleus contains most of the cell???s genetic material.. . The nucleus is a dark structure located in the middle of the cell. It controls the cell's activities, and acts like the cell's brain. Inside the nucleus there is DNA which contains genetic information. The cytoplasm is a jelly-like substance inside the cell where most of the cell's activities take place. It's made out of water and other chemicals. All cell parts, except the nucleus, are located in the cytoplasm.. . Kinds of nucleus : . . Bose-Einstein nucleus (2 kinds, 11 facts) - Nucleus of even A-number (i.e., those with integral spin) (cf. Fermi-Dirac nuclei). Bose-Einstein nuclei do not obey the exclusion principle, and their ground state has zero angular momentum. . . deuteron (6 facts) (d) - The nucleus of deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen. It consists of one proton and one neutron bound together., The nucleus of a deuterium atom. md = 2.01355 amu..  . even-odd nucleus (3 facts) - Nucleus that contain even numbers of protons but odd numbers of neutrons. . . Fermi-Dirac nuclei (2 facts) - Nuclei of odd A-number (i.e., nuclei that do not have integral spin) (cf. Bose-Einstein nuclei). Fermi-Dirac nuclei therefore obey the exclusion principle (q.v.). . . isomer (2 facts) - Nucleus with the same A and Z numbers but in different energy states. . . isotone (2 facts) - Nucleus with the same number of neutrons but with different A and Z numbers. . . isotope (3 facts) - An atomic nucleus having the same number of protons as a more commonly found atomic nucleus but a different number of neutrons. For example, the hydrogen nucleus has a single proton; deuterium has one proton and one neutron and would be called an isotope of hydrogen. (see neutron; proton.), Two nuclei with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are said to represent the same element, but different isotopes. For example, helium-3, with two protons and one neutron in each nucleus, and helium-4, with two protons and two neutrons, are two different isotopes of helium. . . nuclide (2 facts) - A species of atomic nucleus, analogous to the word \"isotope\" for a species of atom. The word is also used to distinguish between atomic nuclei that are in different energy states. . . proton (13 facts) (p) - A subatomic particle with positive electric charge. Every atom has at least one proton in its nucleus; the number of protons determines the element. For example, all atoms with one proton are hydrogen, all atoms with two protons are helium, and so on., One of the constituents of the atomic nucleus. It is a spin-1/2 particle carrying positive electric charge. The proton is the lightest baryon and, as a result, is the particle into which all other baryons eventually decay. It is believed to be absolutely stable, but certain theories (GUTs) predict it will decay very, very slowly., A baryon made of two up quarks and a down quark. It possesses a positive electromagnetic charge and can only be found in atomic nuclei. A single proton is a hydrogen nucleus., A massive particle with positive electrical charge found in the nuclei of atoms. Composed of two up quarks and one down quark. The proton's mass is 938.3 MeV, slightly less than that of the neutron., A positively charged elementary particle; the nucleus of a hydrogen atom. Mass of proton 1.00728 amu = 1.6726 ?? 10-24 g = 1836.12 me. . . triton (6 facts) (T) - The nucleus of the tritium atom. . .

Atomic nuclei are composed of two types of particles, protons and neutrons, which are collectively known as nucleons. A proton is simply the nucleus of an ordinary hydrogen atom, the lightest atom, and has a unit positive charge. A neutron is an uncharged particle of about the same mass as the proton. The number of protons in a given nucleus is the atomic number of that nucleus and determines which chemical element the nucleus will constitute when surrounded by electrons.. . The total number of protons and neutrons together in a nucleus is the atomic mass number of the nucleus. Two nuclei may have the same atomic number but different mass numbers, thus constituting different forms, or isotopes, of the same element.

It is usually very friendly, but has an uncanny ability to know when it needs to protect and when everything is okay. The American Pit Bull Terrier can be willful and needs a firm hand. They are generally okay with other pets if they are raised with them from puppy hood.  For the most part they are very friendly, but not recommended for most people. Excellent with children in the family, they have a high pain tolerance and will happily put up with rough child play.\" http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/americanpitbull.htm","NLTKTokens":["much","hope","pit","bulls","winning","best","read","following","legal","battle","denver","appeal","results","http","network.bestfriends.org/animallawcoalition/news/postdetail.aspx","gu=animallawcoalition","problem","lies","owners","raised","dangerous","dogs","fighting","pit","bull","owners","realize","dangerous","even","normally","friendly","pit","bull","without","strict","regimen","obedience","training","would","prevent","menace","pit","bulls","happen","like","owners","never","train","dogs","breeds","people","fight","dogs","raise","vicious","order","guard","property","i.e","junk","yard","lot","work","gain","public","confidence","beautiful","animal","p.s","danjelho","pit","bull","dangerous","initiating","attack","however","cause","damage","dogs","attack","begins","actually","initiating","attack","usually","apparent","reason","toy","breeds","worst","animal","takes","special","kind","person","owner","person","willing","make","sure","animal","well","trained","socialized","entire","problem","fault","dogs","people","done","done","dogs","american","pit","bull","terrier","breed","people","think","pit","bull","fact","wonderful","lived","know","american","pit","bull","terrier","good-natured","amusing","extremely","loyal","affectionate","family","good","children","adults","almost","always","obedient","always","eager","please","master","extremely","courageous","intelligent","guard","full","vitality","highly","protective","owners","owner","property","fight","enemy","death","usually","friendly","uncanny","ability","know","needs","protect","everything","okay","american","pit","bull","terrier","willful","needs","firm","hand","generally","okay","pets","raised","puppy","hood","part","friendly","recommended","people","excellent","children","family","high","pain","tolerance","happily","put","rough","child","play","http","www.dogbreedinfo.com/americanpitbull.htm"]}

{"ID":34111231,"ABSTRACT":"There has been news overseas of scandals regarding national exams and the educaional systems in other countries. Remember, what makes the news is generally an isolated case, but it has been generalized to sound like common practice. At the same time, there are many different educational systems and criteria that it is hard to make comparisons. For example, as a general rule, most US universities will not consider a candidate for a Master's program if the Bachelor's was completed in less than 4 years. Countries that follow the British educational style will have spent a period of \"pre-university\" that can take up to 2 years before taking the final exams for the chosen papers. Then, completion of a Bachelor's degree takes only 3 years. To compare with the American system, we have the general education subjects before specialization tends to occur. In effect, bith systems are doing the same thing, it's a hang up about the time factor or classification of an area with which most are not familiar.. . Another idea to help keep in mind, for professional types of degrees and qualifications, each country has specific ideas as to what should be in the curriculum. For example, medical schools also empasize patient care and communication as part and parcel. Other countries medical degrees take less time as they empasize more on pathology and diagnosis. . . One more thing to remember, in the US we don't have a national standard. The US universities are independent and may not even accept credits from another US university. Many universities DO offer bridging programs where should you not meet the tradtitional requirements for a master's degree, you can apply your experience as well as take a few subjects you lack to re-evaluate your situation. Thos means you won't have to repeat everything - just fill in the gaps in your education that do not meet the standards of a particular university.","NLTKTokens":["news","overseas","scandals","regarding","national","exams","educaional","systems","countries","remember","makes","news","generally","isolated","case","generalized","sound","like","common","practice","time","many","different","educational","systems","criteria","hard","make","comparisons","example","general","rule","us","universities","consider","candidate","master","program","bachelor","completed","less","years","countries","follow","british","educational","style","spent","period","pre-university","years","taking","final","exams","chosen","papers","completion","bachelor","degree","takes","years","compare","american","system","general","education","subjects","specialization","tends","occur","effect","bith","systems","thing","hang","time","factor","classification","area","familiar","another","idea","help","keep","mind","professional","types","degrees","qualifications","country","specific","ideas","curriculum","example","medical","schools","empasize","patient","communication","part","parcel","countries","medical","degrees","less","time","empasize","pathology","diagnosis","thing","remember","us","n't","national","standard","us","universities","independent","may","even","accept","credits","another","us","university","many","universities","offer","bridging","programs","meet","tradtitional","requirements","master","degree","apply","experience","well","subjects","lack","re-evaluate","situation","thos","means","n't","repeat","everything","fill","gaps","education","meet","standards","particular","university"]}

{"ID":242949115,"ABSTRACT":"Of course not.  Most people do not know this, but Walt Disney actually created Disneyland for adults!  He wanted a place where both children and adults could learn and have fun together.  Disney believed in being a child at heart.  Children search, discover, and are not embarrased to admit they have learned.  Disneyland was created as place of education, hope, and love to all people.  Embracing the child within is healthy and is something that should be explored by every individual, everyday.  I'm not naive enough to think that elements in Walt Disney's original plan for Disneyland have not been changed for business purposes, and there is the slowly spreading belief that Disney is for children, when Walt Disney firmly believed that any business geared directly toward children would not be successful.  So, no Disneyland is for everyone.  It's for discovering that sometimes fantasy is more real than reality.  . . One time a man was at Disneyland and sat on a bench next to another, older man who, at the time, was difficult to recognize.  The younger man mentioned how Disneyland kept you from reality, and the older man promptely answered that this park was reality, and it was everything outside of it, that was fantasy.  That older man was Walt Disney.. . So go enjoy Disneyland.  Learn the beautiful history behind It's a Small World, so you may enjoy it.  Understand it's appearance at the World's Fair.  Know what a step that World's Fair was in technology and the understanding of other cultures.  Learn and explore.  It's a small world after all, with a lot to learn in it.

Similarly, if the amount of lift drops below the weight of the airplane, the plane will descend. By increasing the lift, the pilot can make the airplane climb. . .  .  Thrust. Thrust is an aerodynamic force that must be created by an airplane in order to overcome the drag (notice that thrust and drag act in opposite directions in the figure above).

{"ID":266891114,"ABSTRACT":"Strep throat is an infection caused by group A streptococcus bacteria, and it's very common among kids and teens. The symptoms of strep throat include fever, stomach pain, and red, swollen tonsils.. . Strep throat usually requires treatment with antibiotics. With the proper medical care - along with plenty of rest and fluids - your child should be back to school and play within a few days.. . How Does Strep Throat Spread?. Anybody can get strep throat, but it's most common in school-age kids and teens. It occurs most often during the school year when big groups of kids and teens are in close quarters.. . The bacteria that cause strep throat tend to hang out in the nose and throat, so normal activities like sneezing, coughing, or shaking hands can easily spread the strep infection from one person to another. That's why it's so important to teach your child the importance of hand washing - good hygiene can lessen your child's chances of getting contagious diseases like strep throat.. . What's the Difference Between Strep Throat and a Sore Throat?. Not all sore throats are step throats. Most episodes of sore throat - which can be accompanied by a runny nose, cough, hoarseness, and red eyes - are caused by viruses. Sore throats usually clear up on their own without requiring medical treatment.. . If your child has strep throat, he or she will start to develop other symptoms within about 3 days. Those symptoms can include:. . red and white patches in the throat . difficulty swallowing . tender or swollen glands (lymph nodes) in the neck . red and enlarged tonsils . headache . lower stomach pain . fever . general discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling . loss of appetite and nausea . rash . Diagnosing Strep Throat. If your child's throat is sore and he or she has other strep throat symptoms, it's a good idea to call your child's doctor. The doctor will likely do a rapid strep test in the office, using a cotton swab to take a sample of the fluids at the back of your child's throat. The test only takes about 5 minutes. If it's positive, your child has strep throat. If the test is negative, the doctor will send a sample to a lab for a throat culture. The results are usually available within a few days.. . Treating Strep Throat. In most cases, doctors prescribe about 10 days of antibiotic medication to treat strep throat. Within about 24 hours after your child starts taking the antibiotics, his or her temperature will probably be back to normal, and your child will no longer be contagious. By the second or third day after taking antibiotics, the other symptoms should start to go away, too.. . Even though your child may not feel sick at that point, it's very important that he or she finish the antibiotic prescription. If your child stops taking antibiotics too soon, bacteria can remain in the throat and the symptoms can return.. . If your child is not treated for strep throat, he or she is most infectious when the symptoms are the most severe but could remain contagious for up to 21 days. Lack of treatment - or not finishing the prescribed course of antibiotics - also could put your child at risk for other health problems, such as rheumatic fever (which can cause permanent damage to the heart), scarlet fever, blood infections, or kidney disease.. . To prevent your sick child from spreading strep throat to others in your home, keep his or her eating utensils, dishes, and drinking glasses separate from those that everyone else is using. Wash them in hot, soapy water after each use. Also, make sure your child doesn't share food, drinks, napkins, handkerchiefs, or towels with other family members. Make sure your child covers his or her mouth and nose during a sneeze or a cough to prevent passing infectious fluid droplets to someone else.. . Caring for Your Child With Strep Throat. There's plenty you can do to help your child feel better. To prevent dehydration, make sure your child drink","NLTKTokens":["strep","throat","infection","caused","group","streptococcus","bacteria","common","among","kids","teens","symptoms","strep","throat","include","fever","stomach","pain","red","swollen","tonsils","strep","throat","usually","requires","treatment","antibiotics","proper","medical","along","plenty","rest","fluids","child","back","school","play","within","days","strep","throat","spread","anybody","get","strep","throat","common","school-age","kids","teens","occurs","often","school","year","big","groups","kids","teens","close","quarters","bacteria","cause","strep","throat","tend","hang","nose","throat","normal","activities","like","sneezing","coughing","shaking","hands","easily","spread","strep","infection","person","another","important","teach","child","importance","hand","washing","good","hygiene","lessen","child","chances","getting","contagious","diseases","like","strep","throat","difference","strep","throat","sore","throat","sore","throats","step","throats","episodes","sore","throat","accompanied","runny","nose","cough","hoarseness","red","eyes","caused","viruses","sore","throats","usually","clear","without","requiring","medical","treatment","child","strep","throat","start","develop","symptoms","within","days","symptoms","include","red","white","patches","throat","difficulty","swallowing","tender","swollen","glands","lymph","nodes","neck","red","enlarged","tonsils","headache","lower","stomach","pain","fever","general","discomfort","uneasiness","feeling","loss","appetite","nausea","rash","diagnosing","strep","throat","child","throat","sore","strep","throat","symptoms","good","idea","call","child","doctor","doctor","likely","rapid","strep","test","office","using","cotton","swab","sample","fluids","back","child","throat","test","takes","minutes","positive","child","strep","throat","test","negative","doctor","send","sample","lab","throat","culture","results","usually","available","within","days","treating","strep","throat","cases","doctors","prescribe","days","antibiotic","medication","treat","strep","throat","within","hours","child","starts","taking","antibiotics","temperature","probably","back","normal","child","longer","contagious","second","third","day","taking","antibiotics","symptoms","start","go","away","even","though","child","may","feel","sick","point","important","finish","antibiotic","prescription","child","stops","taking","antibiotics","soon","bacteria","remain","throat","symptoms","return","child","treated","strep","throat","infectious","symptoms","severe","could","remain","contagious","days","lack","treatment","finishing","prescribed","course","antibiotics","could","put","child","risk","health","problems","rheumatic","fever","cause","permanent","damage","heart","scarlet","fever","blood","infections","kidney","disease","prevent","sick","child","spreading","strep","throat","others","home","keep","eating","utensils","dishes","drinking","glasses","separate","everyone","else","using","wash","hot","soapy","water","use","make","sure","child","n't","share","food","drinks","napkins","handkerchiefs","towels","family","members","make","sure","child","covers","mouth","nose","sneeze","cough","prevent","passing","infectious","fluid","droplets","someone","else","caring","child","strep","throat","plenty","help","child","feel","better","prevent","dehydration","make","sure","child","drink"]}

{"ID":25432077,"ABSTRACT":"Heat is vibration of particles, but the catalyst for making those particles vibrate can be many things, from friction to chemical. One such catalyst, light, is constantly passing through almost every area of the universe at all times, and when this light impacts matter, heat results. However this heat is irrelevant to our conversation, because your asking about empty space (which is almost impossible to find and/or create). The fact is this:. How do we know the temperature of an area of space, or more accurately how far from absolute zero it is, without introducing some piece of matter that is designed to determine the information we seek? The introduction of such a device would receive impacts from the light passing through said space field, corrupting the temperature reading.. The point of this is that empty space does have a temperature close to ab zero (not ab zero due to dark energy radiating heat), empty space is an improbable eventuality, and if it did or does ever happen no-one will be there to observe it. besides that, space is not empty and thus is not ab zero. . as a side note, particles are a vibration of impure energy, and are only seen because the energy is moving at the speed of light giving the illusion that it is material. Therefore, even matter is just space that is not empty, and thus is not ab zero.","NLTKTokens":["heat","vibration","particles","catalyst","making","particles","vibrate","many","things","friction","chemical","catalyst","light","constantly","passing","almost","every","area","universe","times","light","impacts","matter","heat","results","however","heat","irrelevant","conversation","asking","empty","space","almost","impossible","find","and/or","create","fact","know","temperature","area","space","accurately","far","absolute","zero","without","introducing","piece","matter","designed","determine","information","seek","introduction","device","would","receive","impacts","light","passing","said","space","field","corrupting","temperature","reading","point","empty","space","temperature","close","ab","zero","ab","zero","due","dark","energy","radiating","heat","empty","space","improbable","eventuality","ever","happen","no-one","observe","besides","space","empty","thus","ab","zero","side","note","particles","vibration","impure","energy","seen","energy","moving","speed","light","giving","illusion","material","therefore","even","matter","space","empty","thus","ab","zero"]}

Each part of the day is then divided into 12 equal parts, for a total of 24 (unequal) hours.. . The first planetary hour of the day is always the same as the planetary day; so sunrise on Monday is the beginning of both the day of the Moon and the hour of the Moon. The hours repeat infinitely in this order:. . *Saturn. *Jupiter. *Mars. *Sun. *Venus. *Mercury. *Moon. . .

Housekeepers are occasionally portrayed in literature as being the most senior staff member and as even making recommendations for the hiring of the butler.. . In modern houses where the butler is the most senior worker, titles such as Majordomo, Butler Administrator, Staff Manager, Estate Manager and Head of Household Staff are sometimes given.. . The word \"butler\" derives from the Old French \"bouteillier\", (meaning \"cup bearer\"), from \"bouteille\", (\"bottle\"). The role of the butler, for centuries, has been that of the chief steward of a household, the attendant entrusted with the care and serving of wine and other bottled beverages (which in ancient times represented a considerable portion of the household's assets.). . In Britain the butler was originally a middle ranking member of the staff of a grand household. In the 17th and 18th centuries the butler gradually became the usually senior male member of a household's staff (in the very grandest households there was sometimes a house steward senior to the butler into the 19th century). Butlers used to always be attired in a special uniform, distinct from the livery of junior servants, but today a butler is more likely to wear a business suit or business casual clothing and appear in uniform only on special occasions.. . The earliest literary mention of a butler is probably that of the man whose release from prison was predicted by Joseph in the biblical account of Joseph's interpretation of the dreams of the Pharaoh's servants.. .

{"ID":35139057,"ABSTRACT":"It may not be one of life???s deepest mysteries, but as scientific conundrums go, it has a peculiar staying power. Why is yawning contagious? .   Researchers recently found that yawning isn???t only catching among people; it is also among chimpanzees.No one has devised a fully convincing explanation of why.. . Compounding the mystery is the odd way in which the contagious power of yawning is largely unconscious. We can see someone yawn, yearn to replicate the action ourselves, and do it, all without thinking about it. Other times we???re aware it is happening, though it still floats somewhere beneath the realm of reason and of purposeful actions.. . So what gives? In an effort to find the answer, the Finnish government recently funded a brain scanning study. The results turned up some hard-to-interpret, possible clues. It also confirmed the obvious: yawn contagion is largely unconscious. Wherever it might affect the brain, it bypasses the known brain circuitry for consciously analyzing and mimicking other people???s actions.. . This circuitry is called the ??mirror-neuron system,??? because it contains a special type of brain cells, or neurons, that become active both when their owner does something, and when he or she senses someone else doing the same thing. . . Mirror neurons typically become active when a person consciously imitates an action of someone else, a process associated with learning. But they seem to play no role in yawn contagiousness, the researchers in the new study found. The cells are have no extra activity during contagious yawning compared with during other non-contagious facial movements, they observed.. . Brain activity ??associated with viewing another person yawn seems to circumvent the essential parts of the MNS [mirror neuron system], in line with the nature of contagious yawns as automatically released behavioural acts???rather than truly imitated motor patterns that would require detailed action understanding,??? wrote the researchers, with the Helsinki University of Technology and the Research Centre J??lich, Germany. The findings are published in the February issue of the research journal Neuroimage.. . But if seeing someone yawn doesn???t activate these centers, what does it do to the brain? The researchers found that it appears to strongly activate at least one brain area, called the superior temporal sulcus. But this activation was unrelated to any desire to yawn in response, so it may be irrelevant to the contagion question, the researchers added.. . Possibly more significant, they wrote, was the apparent deactivation of a second brain area, called the left periamygdalar region. The more strongly a participant reported wanting to yawn in response to another person???s yawn, the stronger was this deactivation. . . ??This finding represents the first known neurophysiological signature of perceived yawn contagiousness,??? the researchers wrote.. . Exactly what the finding means is less clear, they acknowledged. The periamygdalar region is a zone that lies alongside the amygdala, an almond-shaped structure deep in the brain in the area of the side of the head. The periamygdalar region has been linked to the unconscious analysis of emotional expressions in faces. Why it would be deactivated in tandem with yawn contagion is unclear, the researchers said.. . One thing seems clear from the study is that ??contagious yawning does not rely on brain mechanisms of action understanding,??? wrote one of the researchers, Riitta Hari of the Helsinki University of Technology, in a recent email. Rather, she continued, it seems to be an ?????automatically??? released (and most likely very archaic) motor pattern,??? or sequence of physical actions.. . In the study, volunteers looked at videos of actors yawning or making other mouth movements. Meanwhile their brains were scanned using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, a system that shows the amount of activity or work going on in various brain areas ba","NLTKTokens":["may","life","deepest","mysteries","scientific","conundrums","go","peculiar","staying","power","yawning","contagious","researchers","recently","found","yawning","catching","among","people","among","chimpanzees.no","devised","fully","convincing","explanation","compounding","mystery","odd","way","contagious","power","yawning","largely","unconscious","see","someone","yawn","yearn","replicate","action","without","thinking","times","aware","happening","though","still","floats","somewhere","beneath","realm","reason","purposeful","actions","gives","effort","find","answer","finnish","government","recently","funded","brain","scanning","study","results","turned","hard-to-interpret","possible","clues","confirmed","obvious","yawn","contagion","largely","unconscious","wherever","might","affect","brain","bypasses","known","brain","circuitry","consciously","analyzing","mimicking","people","actions","circuitry","called","mirror-neuron","system","contains","special","type","brain","cells","neurons","become","active","owner","something","senses","someone","else","thing","mirror","neurons","typically","become","active","person","consciously","imitates","action","someone","else","process","associated","learning","seem","play","role","yawn","contagiousness","researchers","new","study","found","cells","extra","activity","contagious","yawning","compared","non-contagious","facial","movements","observed","brain","activity","associated","viewing","another","person","yawn","seems","circumvent","essential","parts","mns","mirror","neuron","system","line","nature","contagious","yawns","automatically","released","behavioural","acts???rather","truly","imitated","motor","patterns","would","require","detailed","action","understanding","wrote","researchers","helsinki","university","technology","research","centre","j??lich","germany","findings","published","february","issue","research","journal","neuroimage","seeing","someone","yawn","activate","centers","brain","researchers","found","appears","strongly","activate","least","brain","area","called","superior","temporal","sulcus","activation","unrelated","desire","yawn","response","may","irrelevant","contagion","question","researchers","added","possibly","significant","wrote","apparent","deactivation","second","brain","area","called","left","periamygdalar","region","strongly","participant","reported","wanting","yawn","response","another","person","yawn","stronger","deactivation","finding","represents","first","known","neurophysiological","signature","perceived","yawn","contagiousness","researchers","wrote","exactly","finding","means","less","clear","acknowledged","periamygdalar","region","zone","lies","alongside","amygdala","almond-shaped","structure","deep","brain","area","side","head","periamygdalar","region","linked","unconscious","analysis","emotional","expressions","faces","would","deactivated","tandem","yawn","contagion","unclear","researchers","said","thing","seems","clear","study","contagious","yawning","rely","brain","mechanisms","action","understanding","wrote","researchers","riitta","helsinki","university","technology","recent","email","rather","continued","seems","automatically","released","likely","archaic","motor","pattern","sequence","physical","actions","study","volunteers","looked","videos","actors","yawning","making","mouth","movements","meanwhile","brains","scanned","using","functional","magnetic","resonance","imaging","system","shows","amount","activity","work","going","various","brain","areas"]}

{"ID":7934630,"ABSTRACT":"Never underestimate the power of a perfectly roasted chicken. A classic example of the beauty of simplicity, roast chicken has the power to comfort, to satisfy, and to impress. The inviting aroma of a juicy roasting bird is enough to make anyone's mouth water, and by the time the chicken emerges from the oven, golden crispy skin sliced through to reveal the tender, moist meat within, everyone will be crazy with anticipation. You don't need to tell them how easy it was to make. Just smile and let them exalt you.. . A Many-Splendored Bird. Roasting a chicken takes a little longer than some other methods of cooking this universally popular bird, but it actually requires very little preparation time-it's mostly just a matter of patience in waiting for the bundle of joy to finish roasting. Another merit of roast chicken is that the leftovers just keep on giving. Roasting two chickens is just as easy as roasting one chicken, and today's roast chicken dinner is tomorrow's chicken enchiladas, chicken soup, chicken salad, chicken fettuccine Alfredo, or chicken sandwich. As if that weren't enough, roast chicken is wonderfully economical, too! Pound for pound, whole chickens are much cheaper than a package of chicken breasts, thighs, or legs.. . Skin is In. Chicken skin contains a great deal of fat, and many people are in the habit of removing it in order to avoid the extra calories. Crispy, fragrant roast chicken skin is absolutely delicious, and, many people insist, the best part of the roast chicken. If you choose to pass up the temptation, though, you still need to leave the skin on the chicken during roasting. Roasting a skinless bird is an exercise in futility. The skin holds in moisture and juiciness. If you skin the chicken before you roast it, the meat will become bone-dry long before it's cooked through. You can carve the chicken then remove the skin from your portion as you see fit. Don't worry-there is no significant difference in calories between removing the skin before or after cooking!. . Divine Brine. One secret to really flavorful, juicy roast chicken is brining-i.e., soaking in salt water. Kosher chickens are always brined before selling; this is one of the reasons that kosher birds tend to taste better. To brine a chicken, dissolve 1/2 cup kosher salt in 1/2 gallon of water, immerse the chicken in the solution and place immediately in the refrigerator. You should let it soak for at least 3 hours, but overnight is great too. When you're ready to cook the chicken, pour out the brine, rinse the chicken cold running water so it won't taste excessively salty, then pat it dry with paper towels. You can still achieve a delicious roast chicken even without brining, but do give it a try sometime. You'll love the results.. . Dress it Up. If you decide to forego the brining step, just remove the chicken from the package, rinse it with cool water, and then pat it dry with paper towels. Rinsing removes residue and some surface bacteria, and drying off the chicken ensures that the skin will brown. Now for the fun part: seasoning! A chicken roasted with nothing but salt, pepper, and butter is very tasty indeed, but it's also easy to build on top of these simple flavors. Herbs are always a good idea. You can chop them up and tuck them under the chicken's skin along with a few pats of butter, or you can simply stuff handfuls of them into the chicken cavity. Wedges of aromatic fruits such as lemons or oranges, and aromatic vegetables such as onions and garlic are great to stuff in with the herbs as well. Filling the cavity with good-smelling things will perfume the bird as it roasts, infusing the meat with incomparable flavor.. . Another approach you can use is to make a blend of dried or fresh ground spices and rub them under the chicken's skin and inside the cavity. For a Southwestern flavor, try chile powder or pureed fresh chiles, cumin, and sage.

The seed will probably sprout, but it'll take a long time to breach the surface - if it ever manages.","NLTKTokens":["shoot","germinating","seed","travels","direction","encounters","least","resistance","going","deeper","underground","sides","finds","soil","tightly","packed","ditto","sides","upward","direction","planted","soil","looser","try","experiment","get","seed","plant","earth","side","transparent","container","use","good-sized","amount","enough","pack","soil","deep","hard","overtop","seed","basically","encase","poor","seed","amounts","brick","soil","keep","exposed","side","side","seed","glass","away","light","best","drap","towel","container","whenever","directly","observing","wait","seed","probably","sprout","long","time","breach","surface","ever","manages"]}
{"ID":380656012,"ABSTRACT":"I'm always amazed at some of the silly answers I see on here.  I wonder if people are that dumb or trying to be funny.  OK well I majored in Biology and took lots of botany classes.  Seeds germinate and grow towards a light source.  That's why you see them curve and turn if you leave them in a window where they have to move to get to the light source.  They are also able to detect gravity and they use that detection method to direct the roots in the proper direction.. . We did an experiment in college where we put seeds on a rotating disk to throw of their gravity detection.  The seeds roots were not able to orientate themselves.. . Keep in mind that nothing in science is 100%, we only have theories.  Since nobody can ask a plant how or why they do something we can only go by our results from experiments. Thus far our experiments show that seeds are able to detect gravity and sunlight to ensure proper orientation.","NLTKTokens":["always","amazed","silly","answers","see","wonder","people","dumb","trying","funny","ok","well","majored","biology","took","lots","botany","classes","seeds","germinate","grow","towards","light","source","see","curve","turn","leave","window","move","get","light","source","able","detect","gravity","use","detection","method","direct","roots","proper","direction","experiment","college","put","seeds","rotating","disk","throw","gravity","detection","seeds","roots","able","orientate","keep","mind","nothing","science","theories","since","nobody","ask","plant","something","go","results","experiments","thus","far","experiments","show","seeds","able","detect","gravity","sunlight","ensure","proper","orientation"]}
{"ID":380656013,"ABSTRACT":"A germinating seed can be turned upside down several times and the root will still start to bend downwards. This behaviour is an example for a tropism, a movement triggered by a stimulus.. . \"It is not the soil???s humidity that causes the direction of the root, since the root will grow downwards and the shoot will grow upwards even if the plant is placed in an earth-filled tube where the upper part is moist and the lower is dry. If the plant is put into a water-filled tube the lower part of which is exposed to light while the upper is darkened, the direction of growth will still not change: a proof that it is independent of light.\" (A. de CANDOLLE, 1834/38). . Rather in 1806 showed the British physiologist A. KNIGHT in a decisive experiment that the direction of root growth is controlled by gravity. Shoot growth thus is mostly negatively geotropic since shoots grow upwards even in complete darkness.","NLTKTokens":["germinating","seed","turned","upside","several","times","root","still","start","bend","downwards","behaviour","example","tropism","movement","triggered","stimulus","soil","humidity","causes","direction","root","since","root","grow","downwards","shoot","grow","upwards","even","plant","placed","earth-filled","tube","upper","part","moist","lower","dry","plant","put","water-filled","tube","lower","part","exposed","light","upper","darkened","direction","growth","still","change","proof","independent","light","candolle","rather","showed","british","physiologist","knight","decisive","experiment","direction","root","growth","controlled","gravity","shoot","growth","thus","mostly","negatively","geotropic","since","shoots","grow","upwards","even","complete","darkness"]}
{"ID":380656020,"ABSTRACT":"Different plant tissues DIFFERENTIATE in the plant embryo, and each differentiated cell-tissue type is sensitive to different environmental factors at the site of seed's germination, thus different tissues will be able to grow in different directions, above soil or below.  . . When a seed germinates, the embryo sprouts a pre-root structure called the HYPOCOTYL that goes downwards, away from the air-dirt interface, so it goes deeper, away from sun and warmth and with gravity, down into the soil more deeply to help form earliest rooting structure.  A pre-leaf structure called the EPICOTYL also grows from embryo, but it grows UPWARDS towards the warmth and the light of the sun.  It might have to push thru some soil before it breaks ground, though.","NLTKTokens":["different","plant","tissues","differentiate","plant","embryo","differentiated","cell-tissue","type","sensitive","different","environmental","factors","site","seed","germination","thus","different","tissues","able","grow","different","directions","soil","seed","germinates","embryo","sprouts","pre-root","structure","called","hypocotyl","goes","downwards","away","air-dirt","interface","goes","deeper","away","sun","warmth","gravity","soil","deeply","help","form","earliest","rooting","structure","pre-leaf","structure","called","epicotyl","grows","embryo","grows","upwards","towards","warmth","light","sun","might","push","thru","soil","breaks","ground","though"]}
